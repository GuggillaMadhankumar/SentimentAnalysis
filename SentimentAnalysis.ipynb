of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you\\'ll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn\\'t dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn\\'t mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn\\'t say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who\\'ll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who\\'ll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"\\n1,\"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only \"\"has got all the polari\"\" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams\\' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master\\'s of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \\'dream\\' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell\\'s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.\"\\n2,\"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I\\'d laughed at one of Woody\\'s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I\\'ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \"\"sexy\"\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"\"Devil Wears Prada\"\" and more interesting than \"\"Superman\"\" a great comedy to go see with friends.\"\\n3,\"Basically there\\'s a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there\\'s a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you\\'re going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\"\\n4,\"Petter Mattei\\'s \"\"Love in the Time of Money\"\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler\\'s play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei\\'s direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\"\\n5,\"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it\\'s not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas\\' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like \"\"dressed-up midgets\"\" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother\\'s slow awakening to what\\'s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they\\'d all be \"\"up\"\" for this movie.\"\\n6,\"I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero\\'s every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I\\'ve got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,If this is so then I must go so lets do it.\"\\n7,\"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70\\'s when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it\\'s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.<br /><br />It\\'s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn\\'t still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can\\'t believe it\\'s still on the air.\"\\n8,\"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I\\'ve seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it\\'s awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, \\'acting,\\' soundtrack (the film\\'s only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.\"\\n9,\"If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it.<br /><br />Great Camp!!!\"\\n10,\"Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.<br /><br />At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn\\'t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.<br /><br />Its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually I just lost interest.<br /><br />I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.<br /><br />For something similar but better try \"\"Brother from another planet\"\"\"\\n11,\"I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.<br /><br />As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn\\'t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.\"\\n12,\"So im not a big fan of Boll\\'s work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he\\'s not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don\\'t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of \"\"SPOILER\"\" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven\\'t even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that\\'s poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he\\'s on screen.\"\\n13,\"The cast played Shakespeare.<br /><br />Shakespeare lost.<br /><br />I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.<br /><br />Is it because \\'The Scottish Play\\' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era.<br /><br />In other words, you cannot improve perfection.<br /><br />I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it.\"\\n14,This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. One of the actors is george clooney and I\\'m not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (The man of constant sorrow). I recommand this movie to everybody. Greetings Bart\\n15,\"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I\\'ve ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it\\'s like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....\"\\n16,\"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it\\'s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.\"\\n17,\"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. <br /><br />There wasn\\'t a continuous minute where there wasn\\'t a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /><br />Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />>The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /><br />>The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????<br /><br />>And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....<br /><br />There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi\\'s?!?! Nazi\\'s???? <br /><br />There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children\\'s movie or an adult movie and wasn\\'t much of either. <br /><br />Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.\"\\n18,\"I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.\"\\n19,\"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They\\'ve taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they\\'ve taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it\\'s simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren\\'t enough naked people in the factual version. It\\'s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist\\'s life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they\\'d favored the rest of the film with same brevity.\"\\n20,\"After the success of Die Hard and it\\'s sequels it\\'s no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of \\'Die Hard on a .....\\' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly \\'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot\\' Stallone\\'s career.<br /><br />Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it\\'s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it\\'s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.<br /><br />You\\'ve got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless \\'turncoat\\' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.<br /><br />He may of been Henry in \\'Portrait of a Serial Killer\\' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors \\'that man never hurt anybody\\' And whilst he surely can\\'t be, it really does look like Ralph Waite\\'s Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.<br /><br />Mention too must go to former \\'London\\'s Burning\\' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can\\'t help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.<br /><br />So forget your better judgement, who cares if \\'that could never happen\\', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! And if you\\'re looking for Qaulen, he\\'s the one wearing the helicopter.\"\\n21,\"I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this \"\"b-movie\"\" in it\\'s entirety.<br /><br />All I have to say is--- save your time and money!!! This has got to be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn\\'t even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all of the actors are paper-thin and not at all believable, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it\\'s almost funny.......almost.<br /><br />The movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are SO utterly unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. They try to appear sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail miserably!!!<br /><br />Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but this is just too painful to watch!!\"\\n22,\"What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won\\'t regret it, it\\'s too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn\\'t anything more other than him, I still liked it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.\"\\n23,\"First of all, let\\'s get a few things straight here: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). b) I DO like several B-Movies because they\\'re hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it\\'s going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it\\'s so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I \"\"vividly\"\" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it\\'s the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I\\'m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it\\'s stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I\\'m giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)\"\\n24,This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It\\'s great to see J.Beals but she\\'s only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can\\'t get work doesn\\'t feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br />\\n25,\"The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter\\'s complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen\\'s mother.<br /><br />It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren\\'t, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries\"\\n26,\"\"\"The Cell\"\" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I\\'ve read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"\"The Cell\"\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don\\'t want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We\\'ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the \"\"genre\"\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But \"\"The Cell\"\" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"\"The Cell\"\" wants to let you \"\"see\"\" what it\\'s all about and not \"\"how\"\" it\\'s all about, and I guess that\\'s what some people don\\'t like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it\\'d at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I\\'ve noticed that I\\'ve kind of been repeating myself. Not because there\\'s nothing else to say, but because I can\\'t stress enough how fantastic I thought \"\"The Cell\"\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as \"\"weird\"\" or \"\"crazy\"\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say \"\"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\"\" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)\"\\n27,\"This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.\"\\n28,\"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I\\'d be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching \"\"America\\'s Funniest Home Videos\"\". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It\\'s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.\"\\n29,\"\\'War movie\\' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era \"\"Cold Mountain,\"\" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain\"\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"\"Glory\"\" director Edward Zwick shame. However, \"\"Cold Mountain\"\" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier\\'s tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\"\"Cold Mountain\"\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada\\'s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada\\'s rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby\\'s deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern \"\"lawman,\"\" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by \"\"the war of Northern aggression,\"\" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it\\'s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, \"\"Cold Mountain\"\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.\"\\n30,\"Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk\\'s Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \"\"message\"\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger\\'s apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who\\'s assigned to Ryan\\'s outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who\\'s leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it\\'s pretty much confined to Young\\'s reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there\\'s no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it\\'s based on (Richard Brooks\\' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don\\'t fit so smoothly. The victim\\'s chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there\\'s a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan\\'s murderous rage.\"\\n31,\"\"\"Ardh Satya\"\" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father\\'s ideologies & incidences of his father\\'s Atrocities on his mother. Anand\\'s approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand\\'s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty\\'s house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.\"\\n32,\"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as \"\"Spider Baby\"\". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can\\'t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There\\'s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.\"\\n33,\"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we\\'re introduced to him at the start of the film, he\\'s been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo\\'s cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can\\'t bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo\\'s troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won\\'t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"\"ridiculous\"\". The first half of the film may be described as \"\"slow\"\" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo\\'s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell\\'Amore or L\\'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist\\'s insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell\\'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that\\'s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it\\'s almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta\\'s best friend, a man whom he hasn\\'t seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it\\'s never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator\\'s expectations, Le Conseguenze dell\\'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell\\'Amore, L\\'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.\"\\n34,\"I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don\\'t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven\\'t even mentioned the killer, I\\'m not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I\\'m concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn\\'t because of their acting talent, I\\'ve certainly seen a lot worse, but I\\'ve also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.\"\\n35,\"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don\\'t usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she\\'s wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens\\' \"\"Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show\"\"). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it\\'s teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I\\'ve been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it\\'s number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.\"\\n36,\"The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That\\'s it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don\\'t watch the movie. I\\'ve warned you.\"\\n37,\"Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this didn\\'t even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can\\'t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80\\'s (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic \\'daft\\' murder (don\\'t worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />It really IS only a movie as they say..\"\\n38,\"Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of \\'here we go again!\\' Week in, week out David Morse\\'s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what\\'s wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!<br /><br />Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can\\'t see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let\\'s hope something good can make it past a first series!!!\"\\n39,\"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it\\'s the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, \"\"We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it\"\" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, \"\"I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip\"\" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The \"\"reasoning\"\" behind each plot turn and new \"\"clue\"\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there\\'s also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for \"\"never shutting up.\"\" She\\'s clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"\"Dr.\"\" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage\\'s character says, \"\"Don\\'t you ever shut up?\"\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she\\'s a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it\\'s so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....\"\\n40,\"It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn\\'t hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn\\'t recommend this movie.\"\\n41,\"This movie is based on the book, \"\"A Many Splendored Thing\"\" by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a topic that comes from Han\\'s personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty\\'s Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances passé, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.\"\\n42,\"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. \"\"How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy\"\"? Gary Busey is know for his \"\"B\"\" movies, but this is a sure \"\"W\"\" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is \"\"confused\"\" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.\"\\n43,\"I had heard good things about \"\"States of Grace\"\" and came in with an open mind. I thought that \"\"God\\'s Army\"\" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, \"\"well, maybe it will get better.\"\" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher\\'s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I\\'m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c\\'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.\"\\n44,\"This movie struck home for me. Being 29, I remember the \\'80\\'s and my father working in a factory. I figured, if I worked hard too, if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own. I\\'ve noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can\\'t get anywhere.<br /><br />I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it\\'s made for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. Ic an\\'t find it anywhere! I\\'d love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas...\"\\n45,\"As a disclaimer, I\\'ve seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn\\'t in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her \\'Let me dance for you scene\\' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical\"\\n46,Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie\\'s charm just doesn\\'t save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don\\'t go out of your way to see this film.\\n47,\"How this film could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot, Abraham\\'s nephew, Lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really? What were the scriptwriters thinking? Was it just ignorance (\"\"I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School\"\") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended? Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one!\"\\n48,\"Preston Sturgis\\' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael\\'s THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis\\' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher\\'s memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane\\'s story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner\\'s right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom\\'s confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry\\'s wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union\\'s headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I\\'m not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE\\'s success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles\\' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one\\'s interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve\\'s son by Tom\\'s son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.\"\\n49,\"Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means it\\'s still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />The genre\\'s well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci\\'s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though. Yellow clues wherever you look.<br /><br />3 out of 10 limping killers\"\\n50,\"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western\\'s Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is \"\"Presented in Shaw Scope\"\", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can\\'t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi\\'s style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don\\'t make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday, so, if you\\'re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?\"\\n51,\"***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br />Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy\\'s unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy\\'s good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It\\'s when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy\\'s proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who\\'s still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City\\'s underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br />Jimmy\\'s life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a \"\"Valentine Day\"\" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It\\'s at Fred\\'s circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn\\'t have the heart to do, for him!\"\\n52,\"Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940\\'s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones.<br /><br />Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides\\' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist\\'s assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela\\'s house. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.\"\\n53,\"I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \"\"where I have I seen them before?\"\" Forget the running time listed on New Line\\'s tape, this ain\\'t no 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\"\\n54,\"The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W. Bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. It\\'s really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can\\'t be denied the right to ever vote again. They\\'ve clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can\\'t help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he\\'s helped create. Sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /><br />Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen. As sympathetic as Robespierres plight is, it\\'s comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he\\'ll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine.\"\\n55,\"As someone has already mentioned on this board, it\\'s very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial \\'distance,\\' a plausible premise, a narrative \\'flow,\\' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /><br />Such is not the case with \\'Love Machine\\'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It\\'s downhill from there.<br /><br />Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a REAL doc, couldn\\'t get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy \\'host,\\' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, I guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn\\'t work. The film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.\"\\n56,\"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it\\'s not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it\\'s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It\\'s just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I\\'d give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you\\'re bored, and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10\"\\n57,\"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It\\'s so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they\\'re lesbians! Nothing rings true in this \"\"Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do\"\" movie. Clunky dialogue like \"\"I don\\'t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn\\'t take it\"\" doesn\\'t help. There\\'s a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter\\'s new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there\\'s a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned.\"\\n58,\"NO SPOILERS!!<br /><br />After Hitchcock\\'s successful first American film, Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier\\'s lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale \\'war effort\\' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock\\'s sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don\\'t believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful \\'freaks\\' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It\\'s a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock\\'s more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time \\'shooting ban\\' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock\\'s most well known films, it\\'s a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock\\'s cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock\\'s original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his \\'deaf\\' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!\"\\n59,\"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />It\\'s not a \"\"big\"\" movie, and doesn\\'t try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they\\'re taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren\\'t other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn\\'t get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn\\'t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.\"\\n60,\"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.\"\\n61,\"I\\'ve just watched Fingersmith, and I\\'m stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show.<br /><br />Not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied.<br /><br />The actors were adequate, but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. Once this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes tedious.<br /><br />And just in case anyone didn\\'t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film.<br /><br />The end scene is disappointing and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went \"\"Ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along!\"\", must have been out for the evening.<br /><br />Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it...\"\\n62,\"So let\\'s begin!)))<br /><br />The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg\\'s movies would usually appear...<br /><br />My intention to see it was certainly JJL being one of my favourite actresses. She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!<br /><br />I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. Still it\\'s quite interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /><br />The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;)<br /><br />Recommend with confidence!))))\"\\n63,\"Besides being boring, the scenes were oppressive and dark. The movie tried to portray some kind of moral, but fell flat with its message. What were the redeeming qualities?? On top of that, I don\\'t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did.\"\\n64,\"An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) gets pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own. Things go OK until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse.<br /><br />I\\'ve seen both the silent version and sound version of \"\"Stella Dallas\"\". Neither one affected me much (and I cry easily) but they were well-made if dated. Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of \"\"Beaches\"\" to get this made. This (predictably) bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today\\'s standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) don\\'t help in supporting roles. Flimsy and dull. Really--who thought this would work? See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead. I give this a 1.\"\\n65,\"DON\\'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci\\'s earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical \"\"bloodbath\"\" that Fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those \"\"helping\"\" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...<br /><br />DON\\'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a \"\"classical\"\" giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci\\'s later works). This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci\\'s non-splatter films - but don\\'t despair, DON\\'T TORTURE still has more than it\\'s fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn\\'t bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10\"\\n66,\"Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC clad, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, the faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark.<br /><br />Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn\\'t going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.<br /><br />In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this film\\x97whether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylum\\x97is hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it\\'s this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of STV crap just about bearable.<br /><br />But be warned, even though the presence of semi-naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humour (as the DVD blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier.<br /><br />3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient.\"\\n67,\"I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. It didn\\'t have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film. The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes, Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore. All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie. Thank you.\"\\n68,\"I\\'m not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in \"\"HP3\"\", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren\\'t the most talented and couldn\\'t carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I\\'m sure everyone who wanted to see it was \"\"hoodwinked\"\"--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I\\'m sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film \"\"Down to the Last Minute\"\" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.\"\\n69,\"This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook \"\"How to write a space disaster movie\"\" and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a \"\"Special Visual Effects\"\" Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I\\'m no NASA expert, but surely it\\'s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.\"\\n70,\"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don\\'t go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I\\'m comin\\' upstairs junior, and I\\'m grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.\"\\n71,\"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven\\'t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some \"\"creepiness factor\"\" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It\\'s not that shocking, it\\'s not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some \"\"gore\"\" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda\\'s \"\"sequel\"\" to AFTERMATH (now available as a \"\"double feature\"\" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don\\'t care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...\"\\n72,\"I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There\\'s tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn\\'t watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like, when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then there was suddenly Mukhsin\\'s voice saying \\'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..\\' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />It captured Malaysian\\'s attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn\\'t sorted out. <br /><br />All i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />It kept me glued to the screen, i couldn\\'t even take my eyes off it. Not even to make out in the cinema. Ha ha.\"\\n73,\"I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800\\'s. Old movies I like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awaken by the voices of men. He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don\\'t want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M. This is super please see the movie.\"\\n74,\"Upon viewing Tobe Hooper\\'s gem, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we\\'d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper\\'s crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones\\' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />I was disappointed the crock didn\\'t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps, in the coming years, we\\'ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed.<br /><br />All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.\"\\n75,\"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It\\'s actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it\\'s flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it\\'s made in the 90s, it doesn\\'t have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I\\'m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can\\'t hate it. I think it\\'s an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.\"\\n76,\"The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don\\'t because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.<br /><br />That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It\\'s not something he\\'s proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.<br /><br />Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he\\'s on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can\\'t touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.<br /><br />Coburn\\'s gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.<br /><br />The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I\\'m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is a lot. <br /><br />For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your film.\"\\n77,\"Maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the DVD, which is with the director as he keeps saying \"\"hi, kids\"\" into the camera like a buffoon), but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator. Turns out it\\'s way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There\\'s a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It\\'s safe to say it\\'s a pretty soulless movie, even if isn\\'t one of the very worst ever made- it\\'s there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their \\'other\\' heads.<br /><br />In this case, we\\'re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by \"\"A Murderer\"\" as he\\'s credited. First off, the director Kazuo \\'Gaira\\' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it\\'s from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there\\'s a \\'wrestling\\' scene that\\'s poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him \\'all\\' there), and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like D\\'Amato\\'s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name I can\\'t remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through \\'Gaira\\' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you\\'d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them \\'speak\\' for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it\\'s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) You just want it to be done with, for the \\'I hate women\\' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.\"\\n78,\"The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass. What does that leave us with? One comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro\\'s manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie.\"\\n79,\"This film took me by surprise. I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! If anything, they UNDERRATED this little gem.<br /><br />Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents \"\"for posterity\"\" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother Mina, and less than forthcoming dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina\\'s son Doug) was going to take us. As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren\\'t a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. \"\"51 Birch Street\"\" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!\"\\n80,\"Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel dumb. But it\\'s a great movie. Not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they\\'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they\\'ll write it all down. Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig\\'s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. Watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. Awesome. You won\\'t be the same after you see it.\"\\n81,\"The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? <br /><br />You really don\\'t need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10\\'s. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the acting TERRIBLE (don\\'t even get me started about the southern accents *y\\'all*) and the story was trite. Just remember....you were warned!\"\\n82,\"Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don\\'t ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn\\'t stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I\\'ve seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I\\'ve seen better performances at a school play, And I\\'ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer\\'s life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.\"\\n83,\"\"\"Fate\"\" leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn\\'t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he\\'s still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can\\'t get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what\\'s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that\\'s titled \"\"The Number 23\"\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it\\'s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn\\'t even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10\"\\n84,\"We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.<br /><br />Just terrible\"\\n85,This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller). I don\\'t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn\\'t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.\\n86,\"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn\\'t call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don\\'t want to know much about the plot, don\\'t keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert\\'s character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. \"\"A Secret Affair\"\" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele\\'s earlier books turned into film.\"\\n87,Oh noes one of these attack of the Japanese ghost girl movies... i don\\'t even remember how many i\\'ve seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... OK this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we\\'ll let me tell you. there\\'s a million of you =D this is one of them. 3/10 i\\'ve seen worse but you won\\'t be missing anything by NOT seeing this!\\n88,\"Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town Reverand who\\'s married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of \"\"Misery\"\" type of way. It\\'s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a \\'black comedy\\', one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can\\'t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. Technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase\"\\n89,\"Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />The first Grudge wasn\\'t entirely bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. Plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />Tired scares, bad acting (except for Amber Tamblyn), and clichés all over the place. Three stories take place, on different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />The chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn\\'t enter a house, others that dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn\\'t that seem just like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yeah, day after day it\\'s getting easier to hold a grudge... against Hollywood bullshits.\"\\n90,\"\"\"Down Periscope\"\" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.<br /><br />It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /><br />The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board.<br /><br />It is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood... which is rare company.<br /><br />Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!\"\\n91,\"If you came here, it\\'s because you\\'ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.<br /><br />I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that\\'s what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.<br /><br />I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, \"\"sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie.\"\" I\\'ll give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their \\'creation\\': Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.<br /><br />And for the record, I *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother\\'s trailer, I swear to God.<br /><br />You know what? I\\'m not writing anymore about this. It\\'s just too painful.\"\\n92,\"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are \"\"Three Smart Girls\"\" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It\\'s a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called \"\"Precious\"\" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father\\'s accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.<br /><br />This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful \"\"Il Bacio\"\" in a police station.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn\\'t all that young, but the girls\\' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.\"\\n93,\"If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter\\'s eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.\"\\n94,\"I watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technology,out do Cecil B. DeMille\\'s classic epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston,Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was let down. Yes, they had all the Biblical characters correct, but they didn\\'t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. If you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some \"\"rivoting\"\" scenes, the \"\"Burning bush\"\", Parting the \"\"RED Sea\"\",drowning \"\"Pharohs Armies\"\", \"\"building Sethi\\'s Pyramids\"\", could have been done with todays\\' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as \"\"Lord of the Rings\"\" or the Matrix. Obviously, they didn\\'t want to leave a LASTING impression of \"\"faith and sacrifice\"\", which is much needed in these trouble times.\"\\n95,\"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody\\'s in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I\\'m beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human.<br /><br />This movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it\\'s predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn\\'t a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here\\'s where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. \"\"I\\'ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that\\'s animated.\"\" \"\"Wheel out the cripple!\"\" And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy\\'s perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see. Fo sho, yo!\"\\n96,\"My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn\\'t be much good. The movie\\'s most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera\\'s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus\\' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don\\'t see the gods and there\\'s no real certainty that they exist. So it\\'s got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn\\'t do anything useful with them.<br /><br />Bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.\"\\n97,\"Well, I like to watch bad horror B-Movies, cause I think it\\'s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (I always compare this movies to - for example - some Spielberg\\'s works and again-and-again don\\'t understand the huge difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood\\'s movies cause it\\'s so inept it\\'s very funny. But people!!! \"\"The Chilling\"\" is not funny and is not even \"\"interesting\"\". It\\'s EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what makes even bad movies watchable. There\\'s no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. It\\'s extremely inept amateurish film. It\\'s definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen (and I had seen a lot of \"\"worst movies\"\" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10\"\\n98,\"This IS the worst movie I have ever seen, as well as, the worst that I will probably EVER see. I see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned...<br /><br />This IS NOT one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.<br /><br />This movie is the equivalent to having a \"\"pet rock\"\" as your friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. Lion\\'s Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film, you would swear George W. Bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.<br /><br />Stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. Its probably how Lion\\'s Gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.\"\\n99,\"I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember, I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach\\'s castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma\\'s home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station\\'s Power Stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it\\'s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we\\'ve been waiting for on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!\"\\n100,\"This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers. The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. This film\\'s 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately not much else lies below it. The plot that is set up doesn\\'t really have time to show. But it\\'s surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and don\\'t expect a deep story.\"\\n101,\"Okay, last night, August 18th, 2004, I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here\\'s what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I\\'ve ever seen. Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble\\'s) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I\\'m assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock \\'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"\"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!\"\"<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn\\'t even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, \"\"You\\'ve heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family.\"\" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn\\'t want to have anything to do with, how in God\\'s name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock \\'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock \\'n roll mind of a man who couldn\\'t even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the public\\'s image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.<br /><br />The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie\\'s work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.<br /><br />All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, \"\"You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc.\"\" Case in point. Even the disclaimer \"\"Based on a True Story\"\" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.<br /><br />All I can say is this, when the film ended I got a free beer so I\\'m glad I went, but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question. Peace.\"\\n102,\"I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper one I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated I didn\\'t play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /><br />The only thing I might change was the upgrade system. I didn\\'t notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn\\'t seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.\"\\n103,\"No, this hilariously horrible 70\\'s made-for-TV horror clinker isn\\'t about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. Still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that\\'s quite tasty in a so-execrable-it\\'s-downright-awesome sort of way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in \"\"Jackson County Jail,\"\" sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney \"\"Witch Mountain\"\" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. Boy, now doesn\\'t that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain\\'t, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis (\"\"Night Tide\"\") Harrington\\'s hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible\\'n\\'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo.\"\\n104,\"It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.<br /><br />This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.<br /><br />The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. Everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their Nazi propaganda.<br /><br />For some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. One must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men.<br /><br />Totally crap and totally depressing.\"\\n105,\"Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy \"\"Show People\"\" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (\"\"High Art Studios\"\") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a \"\"serious\"\" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent film with a few \"\"sound effects\"\" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. A treasure of a film.\"\\n106,\"The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors\\' and director, Attenborough\\'s credits that puzzles me: aren\\'t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? I am hoping I would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the \"\"knowledgeable\"\" personnel (insider) of the film.\"\\n107,\"While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don\\'t have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director\\'s chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, \"\"Row Row Row your Boat\"\" in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.\"\\n108,\"Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with \"\"Citizen Kane\"\": It\\'s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of \"\"Kane\"\" are evident. Still, it\\'s very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There\\'s also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she\\'s sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. For all that, I was quite fascinated.\"\\n109,\"This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared \"\"not handsome\"\". But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true \\'romance\\' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.\"\\n110,\"Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called \"\"movie.\"\" They described \"\"blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence.\"\" I saw no \"\"intrigue.\"\" I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no \"\"violence.\"\" At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with \"\"impervious\"\" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the \"\"plot.\"\" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. Whatever you may choose to do, I will always remain<br /><br /> Correct,<br /><br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /><br /> <br /><br />P.S. I was not blinded by the choreography.\"\\n111,\"I liked Boyle\\'s performance, but that\\'s about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what\\'s with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That\\'s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges\\' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung, or thereabouts. I wasted $4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.\"\\n112,It\\'s terrific when a funny movie doesn\\'t make smile you. What a pity!! This film is very boring and so long. It\\'s simply painfull. The story is staggering without goal and no fun.<br /><br />You feel better when it\\'s finished.\\n113,\"So well made, no CGI crap. Has anyone else been on the \"\"Jumping Crocs\"\" tour of Darwin\\'s Adelaide River before? Black Water was WAY realistic; Rogue was a bit cringeworthy.<br /><br />Thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven\\'t really seen her before. And the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. <br /><br />V. suspenseful - I would compare it to Jaws over any other man eating animal flick. <br /><br />Got the hole Aussie thing down pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys, as well. <br /><br />Loved it!\"\\n114,\"The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, obligatory romance, and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase in here, and a dandy it is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer \"\"recruited\"\" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third tier actor, such as Quinn, is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. Usually, such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, agent that recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines, which converge in gradual fashion toward the end, and not all at once as we\\'re used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days, without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast, costumes, and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. This is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars.\"\\n115,\"this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen....the stark scenery...the isolation...the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion...a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication...the acting is completely natural...but for me as a\"\"foodie\\' the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast..i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well...whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don\\'t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette\\'s menu and choice of wines are authentic...and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be..this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it\"\\n116,\"Set in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his finest) and Robespierre (a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to \"\"The Reign Of Terror\"\" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film \"\"Man Of Iron\"\" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play \"\"The Danton Affair\"\" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris.\"\\n117,\"Usually I\\'m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens...but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through. Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim\\'s performance was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This has no redeeming qualities, even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away!\"\\n118,\"I have now seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodóvar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this film, so it\\'s not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comedic edge to this movie, I certainly couldn\\'t find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie.\"\\n119,\"I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood\\'s novel \\'The Robber Bride\\', and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman\\'s crazy female friends. It\\'s fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood\\'s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...<br /><br />Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re entirely made up for the movie, I\\'ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren\\'t enough to carry the movie. Zenia\\'s manipulations aren\\'t interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man\\'s life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories -- to a man. Because it\\'s not important if a man doesn\\'t hear them.<br /><br />I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man\\'s story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn\\'t read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you\\'re out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It\\'s the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. It\\'s like Zenia\\'s revenge on Margaret Atwood.\"\\n120,this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can\\'t expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn\\'t matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.\\n121,\"Ingrid Bergman, playing dentist Walter Matthau\\'s faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in a record booth (Ingrid\\'s monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he\\'s too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. Hawn (who won a Supporting Oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This bedroom farce isn\\'t terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of \"\"Any Wednesday\"\" besides), but it\\'s a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. \"\"Cactus Flower\"\" is a lovely sigh! *** from ****\"\\n122,\"\"\"A bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend. Learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing. Unfortunately, the man discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage,\"\" according to the DVD sleeve\\'s synopsis.<br /><br />The synopsis isn\\'t entirely correct, as it turns out.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie opens with a dizzying \"\"out-of-body\"\" example of handsome director Winston Rekert (as Paul Sharpe)\\'s newly discovered \"\"astral body\"\" experience; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight. Young Andrew Bednarski (as Matthew Sharpe), being a kid, draws pictures of \"\"The Blue Man\"\", as his murder spree begins. Handsome detective John Novak (as Stewart Kaufman) discovers the victims are connected to Mr. Rekert. Mr. Novak\\'s investigation leads to the supernatural; a prime example of which is Karen Black (as Janus), with whom Rekert fears he is falling in love.<br /><br />Several in the cast perform well; but, \"\"The Blue Man\"\" winds up tying itself up in a knot. Aka \"\"Eternal Evil\"\", its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good.\"\\n123,\"Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . At the time I couldn`t believe how movies like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . Maybe it is ?\"\\n124,\"This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces (\"\"The Fall of the House of Usher\"\", \"\"Dance of Death\"\" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, \"\"The Cat and the Canary\"\", \"\"The Old Dark House\"\", \"\"Night of Terror\"\" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I won\\'t go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.<br /><br />Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.<br /><br />Dan Basinger 8/10\"\\n125,\"I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap! First, and this is very important, never ever watch this movie sober! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel was made intentionally bad. I just can\\'t get over how fake the snowman is, which is why its always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.\"\\n126,\"\"\"Revolt of the Zombies\"\" proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn\\'t necessarily make lightning strike twice.<br /><br />The Halperin brothers, responsible for the horror classic \"\"White Zombie\"\", made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close-ups of Lugosi\\'s eyes from that previous film. There was a court battle with the \"\"White Zombie\"\" film\\'s rights owners, who didn\\'t want the Halperins to be able to use the word \\'zombie\\' in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money simply by having the word \\'Zombie\\' appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. The zombies here seem not to be true walking dead, but simply hypnotism victims.<br /><br />Wanna create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.<br /><br />THE LAME PLOT: Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind-control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn\\'t worth spit.<br /><br />This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I\\'ve ever seen. You\\'d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting isn\\'t even good. This movie makes the racially insensitive \"\"King of the Zombies\"\" (which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. It makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese fest \"\"Invisible Invaders\"\" seem like a serious drama. This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits list the ironically named company Favorite Films. I\\'m not sure whose favorite film this would be, but they\\'re obviously an idiot.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance, or classic films.\"\\n127,\"The complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps, like Grey\\'s Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.\"\\n128,\"This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn\\'t see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper\\'s review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don\\'t really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.\"\\n129,\"I remember seeing this film in the mid 80\\'s thought it a well paced and well acted piece. I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and the had to get a copy of DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from \"\"the bank\"\". Even Jack Barclays car dealership is still there selling Bentleys and Rolls Royces.<br /><br />It\\'s look like the DVD is due a Region 2 release soon. The region 1 copy I is very poor quality. Let\\'s hope they\\'ve cleaned it up.<br /><br />Only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but I guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with.\"\\n130,\"Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000. Close ups predominated it. Close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. The story was also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema.\"\\n131,\"Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.<br /><br />The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he\\'s sleeping. Morty, or \"\"Micky\"\" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.<br /><br />The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it\\'s up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy\\'s situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, \"\"you must be the short depressed kid we ordered.\"\" Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, \"\"you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn\\'t fit in.\"\" But before it\\'s all over, Murray\\'s performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.<br /><br />The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but \"\"it just doesn\\'t matter\"\". This is a pretty good film on many levels. Don\\'t let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. Murray will keep you laughing throughout. Just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.\"\\n132,\"\"\"The Danish Bladerunner\"\" is boldly stated on the box. Are you kidding me?! This film is a complete drag. When I\\'m thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the vcr, so I won\\'t miss anything. Not this time. I actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so I wouldn\\'t have to go back. Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? It\\'s mindboggling. One of the premises of film, is that our hero (who\\'s a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the Microsoft Office paperclip finally caught on in the future). When he loses the assistant in the movie, he\\'s helpless and can\\'t get into any computers. HE\\'S A HACKER! It\\'s like saying, that you can\\'t drive your car, if you don\\'t have your lucky \"\"driving-cap\"\" on. I won\\'t even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock...\"\\n133,\"This movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but Im watching movies based on the fact that what Im watching is not actually happening on the screen. These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species.<br /><br />This should be banned and destroyed. I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market!!<br /><br />This movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.\"\\n134,\"Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt, and Corey Feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something I\\'d love to try sometime. Where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, \"\"action\"\" in places. This is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was\\'s love to star in. I actually felt embarrassed for the \"\"stars\"\" in this \"\"film\"\". The only thespian missing to top this turd was Gary Coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad.<br /><br />There was one part in the film where Carol Alt screamed, \"\"DO YOU THINK I\\'M AN IDIOT?!?\"\" Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy... GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this! This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part in.<br /><br />I would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so I barely paid attention.\"\\n135,\"This film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or Ms. English tried). Assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English\\'s experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.<br /><br />I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English\\'s talents didn\\'t translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn\\'t recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn\\'t translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English get the changes & updates or subtleties right. If only she (as writer, director AND producer) had reached out for some assistance, I think it could have been good. But it was not.<br /><br />It\\'s so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone\\'s time & money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: \"\"Let\\'s remake a classic with worse everything!\"\"\"\\n136,\"I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy\\'s sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the Maysles\\' to make \"\"Big Edie\"\" and \"\"Little Edie\"\" the subject of a film. They certainly could be considered the \"\"skeletons\"\" in the family closet. The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. I\\'d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. \"\"Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?\"\"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not have it. Facets does, though.\"\\n137,\"C\\'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It\\'s just an old 60\\'s TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow\\'s) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />This use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />Except a few notable exceptions i.e \"\"The city on the edge of forever\"\" , \"\"assignment Earth\"\" and \"\"Tomorrow is Yesterday\"\" The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it\\'s boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a LOT of rubbish! He doesn\\'t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper ! Every expense spared or what !\"\\n138,\"I just watched this movie on it\\'s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) \"\"Mork & Mindy\"\" as a kid, mostly for Robin William\\'s zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin\\'s journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin\\'s struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that\\'s the \"\"Taxi\"\" behind the scenes biopic.)<br /><br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those Robin Williams and \"\"Mork & Mindy\"\" fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!\"\\n139,\"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese \"\"Green Card\"\". I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo\\'s Hong Kong films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn\\'t laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this \"\"a refreshing breath of comedy\"\". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that \"\"Spike of Bensonhurst\"\" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!\"\\n140,\"Before I begin, let me get something off my chest: I\\'m a huge fan of John Eyres\\' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called \"\"Bloody Shootout\"\" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree \\x96 Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her \\x96 Michael Silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son\\'s coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls \"\"a hamburger without the fries\"\"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making Silvano\\'s life a misery.<br /><br />Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn\\'t stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle), to pay Silvano back for killing Meeker\\'s wife.<br /><br />Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. But that is the film\\'s main flaw, since there\\'s nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good, with Keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.\"\\n141,\"Ye Lou\\'s film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting doesn\\'t help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I don\\'t mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film \"\"has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography\"\", but I don\\'t think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century, and I don\\'t believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments don\\'t add to its watchability.<br /><br />The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.<br /><br />All in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10\"\\n142,\"After hearing about George Orwell\\'s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, I\\'m now 37, but never having read the book, I am totally confused as to what I\\'ve just seen.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i\\'m sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I\\'m still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.<br /><br />On the plus side...<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...<br /><br />There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about (Eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.<br /><br />Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn\\'t he on the front line? Why doesn\\'t he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he\\'s drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak & ill? Why isn\\'t he brainwashed like the rest of them? What\\'s the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven\\'t read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it\\'s very annoying all the same.<br /><br />Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.<br /><br />I personally can\\'t abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you\\'ve read the book because if this film really is the \\'literal translation\\' that I\\'ve seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />There\\'s no denying that it was light years ahead of it\\'s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.<br /><br />I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i\\'m to make any sense out of this.<br /><br />All in all, very disappointed in something I\\'ve waited for years to watch.\"\\n143,\"This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop\\'s pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.\"\\n144,\"I just got back from this free screening, and this \"\"Osama Witch Project\"\" is the hands-down worst film I\\'ve seen this year, worse than even \"\"Catwoman\"\" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.<br /><br />In \"\"September Tapes,\"\" a \"\"film crew\"\" of \"\"documentary journalists\"\" heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife\\'s death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />They \"\"made\"\" eight tapes on their journey, which now \"\"document\"\" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a \"\"documentary.\"\")<br /><br />The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching \"\"MacGyver\"\" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. I don\\'t know why he didn\\'t just wear a sign on his back that said \"\"Shoot me.\"\"<br /><br />The crew\\'s translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. <br /><br />You wish they\\'d brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.<br /><br />Around \"\"Tape 4,\"\" I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.\"\\n145,\"I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid. <br /><br />Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell\\'s voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.<br /><br />As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I\\'m used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.<br /><br />So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.\"\\n146,\"A family is traveling through the mid West. There\\'s widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben\\'s little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town named Hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. Their car breaks down and they\\'re forced to stay. They soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil.<br /><br />The story is not that good. People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. Also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. The acting is pretty poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. Only old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones give good performances. Still this movie does work. It forgoes blood and gore (there\\'s some but this is PG) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. The acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. Martin especially chews the scenery in his role. I can\\'t explain exactly why I (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. It\\'s a quiet kind of horror that isn\\'t made anymore. Hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered.

We learn little about this woman\\'s marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she\\'s also recently learned she\\'s pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn\\'t want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. Some scenes (such as Knight\\'s first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play \\'Simon Says\\') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we\\'ve been made privy to. He allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). It\\'s a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. Some may shun Coppola\\'s unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****\"\\n148,This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. Some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. Major parts of the book were once again chopped out.You lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. Also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. Also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.One of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. Over all disappointing.\\n149,\"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there\\'s nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don\\'t really think they exist. I think they bought this script at \"\"Scripts-R-Us\"\", where you buy a standard blank \"\"Monster Movie\"\" script and just fill in the blanks. There\\'s a monster stalking us. Let\\'s split up. (They actually \"\"let\\'s split up\"\" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk.<br /><br />I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don\\'t want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don\\'t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than...\"\\n150,\"A young girl becomes a war-time marine\\'s pen-pal, and when he visits at war\\'s end expecting someone a bit more \"\"available,\"\" comic complications ensue. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn\\'s dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from \"\"Casablanca\"\" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the \"\"jumping\"\" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who \"\"tucks\"\" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in \"\"F-Troop\"\" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker\\'s actual pen-pal friend. A fine, lightweight \"\"coming home\"\" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.\"\\n151,\"This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. <br /><br />Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful, though it couldn\\'t catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. <br /><br />All said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family.\"\\n152,\"Robert Altman\\'s downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton\\'s book \"\"McCabe\"\" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don\\'t merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman\\'s pacing is deliberately slow. There\\'s hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. It\\'s a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****\"\\n153,\"What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.<br /><br />Spoiler of sorts follows.<br /><br />Poor Cedric; he apparently didn\\'t know what hit him. Poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didn\\'t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.<br /><br />On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this film. Subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my French is \"\"presque rien.\"\" I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture.

However, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. I can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as I did watching this movie. Andy Griffith\\'s ghost dressed in Native American garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime.

Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It\\'s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets\\' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.<br /><br />The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.<br /><br />It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen\\'s methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can\\'t lose Jane Austen\\'s technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth\\'s wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody\\'s follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen\\'s Elizabeth (at least in Austen\\'s eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley\\'s Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.\"\\n157,\"I\\'ve always enjoyed films that depict life as it is.

His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers. I don\\'t know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn\\'s performances, except that they truly feel real. \"\"A River Runs Through It\"\" is a wonderful film.<br /><br />8.6 out of 10\"\\n158,\"The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it\\'s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.\"\\n159,\"This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece,even though it got good actors , great script and rather good photograph was not a so called \"\"blockbuster\"\" movie in my Country.

This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance.<br /><br />The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in like a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It\\'s up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles.<br /><br />In the end, this movie feels like a poor man\\'s Van Helsing. If you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary Monday night.

I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can remember.<br /><br />It\\'s the sort of film that is worth trying the once. I can see why it wasn\\'t released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV. I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film, it didn\\'t much details except something like, \\'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up, Jared Harris Stars\\'. I\\'d never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />The film had a slow start but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a huge fan, I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon\\'s accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent. THe make-up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A *SPOILER*:<br /><br />As I mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. As for Lennon\\'s rude line in the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it.<br /><br />It is quite different from the other biographical films I\\'ve seen where it\\'s about how The Beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. E.g. \\'Backbeat\\'.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say, if you\\'re a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. At only about 95 minutes long, it\\'s worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the \\'comments page\\' for this film, I\\'d be very interested.\"\\n165,\"An American Werewolf in London had some funny parts, but this one isn\\'t so good.

Give us a break! Here\\'s my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? Answer: Hell no.<br /><br />Imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you\\'ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. Were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we\\'d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />Let\\'s call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple.

Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film.

One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello\\'s flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he isn\\'t sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? Either way, I don\\'t want to see the little boy grant him the second.<br /><br />It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there\\'s hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who\\'s origins are never revealed. That\\'s just plain irritating! <br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.\"\\n170,\"I can\\'t emphasize it enough, do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter, you\\'d best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right, perhaps I\\'m overexaggerating a little. This isn\\'t the worst kids\\' movie... no, let me rephrase that. This isn\\'t the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be \"\"Jack\"\", which I\\'ve been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adults won\\'t learn anything surprising (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don\\'t usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I degress).<br /><br />I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There\\'s a better movie, \"\"Kiki\\'s Delivery Service\"\", that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the adults will like it too!<br /><br />By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind, if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.\"\\n171,\"Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Phat Beach. However, don\\'t rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake.<br /><br />I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny \"\"hood\"\" movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason\\'s Lyric. If you are lookin for some good black \"\"booty\"\" go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be slightly amused.<br /><br />***3 out of 10***\"\\n172,\"The Elegant Documentary -<br /><br />Don\\'t watch this movie ... if you\\'re an egotistical know-all student of physics. This much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.<br /><br />Do watch this movie! - If you\\'re one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including Relativity, Quantum, String and M-theory.<br /><br />What a brilliantly architected documentary. Starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a Universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I have always had a huge appreciation of Mathematics. This movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you\\'re about to fail the grade.<br /><br />The show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. It therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. I found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.<br /><br />We are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. This movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the Hubble Telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. M-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of \\'possibility\\'.<br /><br />It just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it\\'s very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of Science and into the realm of Philisophy.<br /><br />You do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to God.<br /><br />Bravo Brian Greene. Well done indeed.<br /><br />P.S. If you\\'re interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the Universe and would like some more insight into the \\'possibilities\\' Quantum mechanics blended with Spirituality (of all things) can bring then I highly recommend that you also watch \"\"What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole\"\". Yes I know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a Shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn\\'t seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - I see things everyday that I\\'ve never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don\\'t divide. But if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don\\'t like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.<br /><br />Then watch \"\"The Secret\"\" (2006 documentary about The Law of Attraction - search for IMDb title \"\"tt0846789\"\"). This information just might change your life profoundly - forever. If you search deeper you might even find the Universe is talking to us with thought (if you\\'ll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. There is a modern day Jesus/Mohammad/Buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I\\'m talking about.<br /><br />I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but I have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the Universe as I do now.\"\\n173,\"In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.<br /><br />The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.<br /><br />The animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series\\' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , it\\'s quite nicely done, and just as sleek as Return of the Joker\\'s animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it\\'s minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans\\' rodent-shaped hearts.<br /><br />Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It\\'s also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).<br /><br />Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season.<br /><br />Overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short Chase Me.\"\\n174,\"I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it\\'s been made ...and simply is. It\\'s one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).<br /><br />Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it\\'s a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I\\'ve no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It\\'s no spectacle other than that it\\'s simply grotesque. It\\'s so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too.<br /><br />The worst thing (if the above wasn\\'t bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they\\'ve tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the \"\"Blair Which\"\", sure enough, there\\'s an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film, there\\'s no other explanation than: \"\"Hey ya\\'ll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!!\"\" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can\\'t make out what they\\'re saying. Also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise.<br /><br />Than finally, there\\'s the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock...<br /><br />My advise: Don\\'t watch this under ANY circumstances.\"\\n175,\"Why can\\'t a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as \"\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\"\" are so bad they\\'re fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. \"\"The Dungeon of Horror\"\" might be the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I\\'ve seen, but thankfully, I can\\'t remember them. The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. The special effects looked like a fifth grader\\'s C+ diorama set in a shoebox. The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! This movie was so bad my DVD copy only had name credits. I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. Though I guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn\\'t needed. This movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as \"\"The Manipulator\"\", the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual (one time) Hollywood leading man-Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend watching \"\"The Dungeon of Harrow\"\" (or \"\"The Manipulator\"\" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (I\\'m kind of cheap) I\\'d have to have $7 or $8 bucks for \"\"Dungeon\"\" and at least ten for \"\"Manipulator\"\". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer\"\\n176,\"This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. After that, we\\'re plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It\\'s a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action kicks in, it\\'s full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson\\'s make-up effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like \"\"Night of the Living Dead\"\" or \"\"Hills Have Eyes.\"\" But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of \"\"House on the Haunted Hill.\"\" The set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?\"\\n177,\"Though I\\'d heard that \"\"Cama de Gato\"\" was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade, I watched it giving it a chance; after all, first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can\\'t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you\\'re ready to give to \"\"Cama de Gato\"\", they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it\\'s an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they\\'re made to look like closeted gays too), made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count\\'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it\\'s not even funny-bad.<br /><br />We\\'ve all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there\\'s gang-rape, spanking, murder, the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage, get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially \"\"Kids\"\" and \"\"Bully\"\"), but Clark\\'s films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />I don\\'t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience\\'s throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn\\'t care a bit about technique (the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling), but he\\'s a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he\\'s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). <br /><br />Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can\\'t even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc). Damn, he can\\'t even decide WHERE to put his camera (there\\'s use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director\\'s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it.<br /><br />It\\'s very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo\\'s, Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in \"\"Carandiru\"\", \"\"Lavoura Arcaica\"\", \"\"Proibido Proibir\"\"). Here, he\\'s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped \"\"actors\"\" in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn).<br /><br />The film opens and ends with real interviews with \"\"typical\"\" (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as \"\"proof\"\" of what he\\'s trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they\\'re middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn\\'t tell). <br /><br />With its dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom, \"\"Cama de Gato\"\" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it\\'s harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. \"\"Cama de Gato\"\" is best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and forgotten.\"\\n178,\"An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well it starts out a bit dark, a dog who escaped the pound, and gets killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven, and comes back. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of Charlie, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she didn\\'t deserve to die, but she is in Heaven now, all good people go to Heaven. Overall this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video of this, you\\'ll find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.\"\\n179,\"This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.<br /><br />In sitting through this, I couldn\\'t help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.<br /><br />Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan\\'s ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.\"\\n180,\"It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov\\'s book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story\\'s deeper meaning to the screen. There are a couple examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov\\'s work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. Why can\\'t we find such talent here in the U.S. ? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.\"\\n181,\"This movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The movie start off with action star Leo Fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the killings start. From start finish Fong delivers in this must see action caper. This movie also co-stars Richard Roundtree.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film as a child but as I got older I realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this film and the action is very, very bad.\"\\n182,\"The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi\\'s fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.<br /><br />That\\'s as poetical as I\\'ll get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.<br /><br />Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I won\\'t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi\\'s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the \\'Death\\' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no one\\'s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won\\'t lie and I\\'ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I\\'ll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it\\'s worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.\"\\n183,\"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I\\'ve seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I\\'d known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can\\'t say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn\\'t wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I\\'m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn\\'t.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That\\'s not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"\"I\\'ll bite yer leg off!\"\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn\\'t free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.\"\\n184,\"A very ordinary made-for-tv product, \"\"Tyson\"\" attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing, and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes Tyson even remotely interesting. A lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans.\"\\n185,\"I\\'m sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn\\'t. You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.<br /><br />I just sat there through most of the movie thinking \"\"Is this supposed to be funny\"\" and \"\"This is the guy from Tenacious D right?\"\". The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It\\'s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You\\'ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn\\'t. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. It didn\\'t. 90 minutes later I\\'d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.<br /><br />It\\'s like, remember years ago when you\\'d see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you\\'d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. Yeah it\\'s like that.<br /><br />I\\'ve enjoyed some of Jack Black\\'s earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I\\'m really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man. If you do this to us again Jack I\\'m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. At the least give you a serious talking to.<br /><br />I know it\\'s a cliché but this is one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen and for so many reasons....\"\\n186,\"I haven\\'t read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It isn\\'t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I\\'ve read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.<br /><br />Still, Stuart Townsend\\'s voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt\\'s vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED\\'s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.<br /><br />However, I\\'ll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.<br /><br />The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It\\'s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn\\'t enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where\\'s the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem\\'s Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.<br /><br />There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let\\'s see, what else can I say? It wasn\\'t too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything.<br /><br />JY<br /><br />Jimboduck-dot-com\"\\n187,\"While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.\"\\n188,\"Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What film was he looking at? Kid Vengeance or God\\'s Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. It is fantastic. It is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. One can only guess as to his reason. I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.\"\\n189,\"I don\\'t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club. They are today\\'s equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don\\'t happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of \"\"life after death\"\" or \"\"god\"\" or \"\"sin\"\" or \"\"the devil\"\" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn\\'t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of \\'cult\\' but due to The 700 Club\\'s vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. For those of you who have seen the movie \"\"The Matrix\"\" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.<br /><br />In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in today\\'s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague. <br /><br />The television ratings system and the \"\"V\"\" chip on TV\\'s should also have a rating called \"\"R\"\" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children.\"\\n190,\"If you wish to see Shakespeare\\'s masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacoby\\'s performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart\\'s as Claudius are well worth the effort.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how clear \"\"Hamlet\"\" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of \"\"Hamlet\"\" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet\\'s indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlet\\'s character together with the aid of Shakespeare\\'s full script.<br /><br />Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says \"\"I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious...\"\" Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father\\'s death (and suspected murder), or his mother\\'s marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius\\' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father\\'s ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must \"\"out\"\" the King\\'s secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius\\' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of Claudius\\' soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He kills Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.\"\\n191,\"The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family\\'s journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he\\'ll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they\\'re aboard the ship to the New World.<br /><br />The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.<br /><br />As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: \"\"Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry\"\" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore\\'s mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn\\'t change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. Though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.\"\\n192,\"Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). All-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy Jean Willes (if she\\'s the Martian, then I say let\\'s open the borders!), to cruel-faced John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver). Makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set.\"\\n193,\"I had before a feeling of mislike for all Russian films. But, after seeing this film I haven´t. This is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the USSR. He knows the art of film making, and can use it very well. If you find this movie: buy or copy it!\"\\n194,\"I watched mask in the 80\\'s and it\\'s currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. It\\'s just plain awful! It is no where near in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that\\'s if mask doesn\\'t put me to sleep first). One of the lesser 80\\'s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on Fox Kids!\"\\n195,\"Phantasm ....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....erm.....terrible.<br /><br />Even though i would love to stick up for this film, i quite simply can\\'t. The movie seems to have \"\"sold out\"\". First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn\\'t) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other Phatasms). Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.<br /><br />The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B.<br /><br />(Possible SPOILER coming Up)<br /><br />To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.<br /><br />Overall very, VERY disappointing. 3 / 10\"\\n196,\"Ludicrous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems appealing to Amidala, 5 years his senior. Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of \"\"fantastic\"\", \"\"wonderful\"\", etc.).<br /><br />Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off Annakin\\'s legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. Doesn\\'t anyone think that\\'s a little out of character? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.<br /><br />I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. None of that here. The story could have been written by a 10 year old.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the CGI is pretty cool.\"\\n197,\"Scotty (Grant Cramer, who would go on to star in the great B-movie \"\"Killer Klowns from outer space\"\") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to \\'dialog\\' the ladies in this bad \\'80\\'s comedy. Not bad as in \\'80\\'s lingo, which meant good. Bad as in bad. With no likable characters, including, but not limited to, a kid who\\'s the freakiest looking guy since \"\"Friday the 13th part 2\"\"\\' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her, and the token fat slob, because after all what would an \\'80\\'s sex comedy be without a fat slob?? Well this one has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of \\'80\\'s sex comedies. And then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel.<br /><br />My Grade:D- <br /><br />Eye Candy: too numerous to count, you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point, think \"\"Bachlor Party\"\" but not as funny, and VERY disturbing.<br /><br />Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass\"\\n198,\"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It\\'s got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn\\'t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that\\'s hard to do when you consider Custer\\'s Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it\\'s prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there\\'s an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There\\'s a lot to take in here though for the picture\\'s two hour plus run time. Custer\\'s arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major\\'s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer\\'s first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn\\'t noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it\\'s interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan\\'s depiction of General Custer in \"\"Santa Fe Trail\"\", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn\\'s portrayal here it\\'s more than evident. But it doesn\\'t come close to that of Richard Mulligan\\'s take on the military hero in 1970\\'s \"\"Little Big Man\"\". Let\\'s just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one\\'s point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer\\'s character, when he stated - \"\"You take glory with you when it\\'s your time to go\"\".\"\\n199,\"The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal\\'s driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.\"\\n200,\"Interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno\\'s replacing Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O\\'Brien and Jay Leno.<br /><br />The film does a good job of sparking viewers\\' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the NBC executives. The portrayal of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought.<br /><br />Still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. Nevertheless, an interesting story.\"\\n201,\"Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare, I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger\\'s The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman\\'s film but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Production\\'s lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?\"\\n202,\"A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien\\'s spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film\\'s title in amazing shining white and blue stating \\'THE THING\\'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.<br /><br />The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn\\'t get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter\\'s greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.<br /><br />Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.<br /><br />Utterly brilliant.<br /><br />Ten Out Of Ten.\"\\n203,\"I absolutely love this film. Everything about it. It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen. The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. I\\'m really glad I ran across this movie. If only there were more genius\\' like justin out there!\"\\n204,\"No one can say I wasn\\'t warned as I have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that\\'s horror aficionados are always dying to know what\\'s in there even if we know it\\'ll be bad).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being polite here). What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.<br /><br />I don\\'t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them, but they didn\\'t even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!\"\\n205,\"A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy\\'s work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy\\'s pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy\\'s work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.\"\\n206,\"If you liked William Hickey in \"\"Prizzi\\'s Honor\"\", he resurrects his character, as Don Anthony in \"\"Mob Boss\"\". This is a very weak \"\"Godfather\"\" satire with few laughs. Stuart Whitman looks perplexed as to what he\\'s doing in this schlock-fest? Morgan Fairchild\\'s performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. Eddie Deezen vacillates between \"\"Three Stooges\"\" slapstick and a bad Woody Allen imitation. Fatally flawed, \"\"Mob Boss\"\" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - MERK\"\\n207,\"I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films. I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90\\'s setting. Some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.\"\\n208,\"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn\\'t on so late at night. It\\'s on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.<br /><br />I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60\\'s and not believing that this stuff can happen.<br /><br />I grew up in the 60\\'s. I\\'m Hispanic and I had a \"\"White\"\" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School. I believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color.<br /><br />I can\\'t wait till the show goes on DVD so I can buy it. This way I can see it from the beginning.\"\\n209,\"This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. From the first \"\"hare krishna\"\" to the last \"\"you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs\"\", I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy\"\\n210,\"I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I\\'m not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.<br /><br />We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can\\'t avoid them all, they\\'ll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we\\'re talking about here, has a great life, she\\'s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this \\'happy Hooker\\' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don\\'t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. <br /><br />Secondly, \\'Pretty Woman\\' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this \\'lady\\' that is without his plastic friend, yep don\\'t leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it\\'s the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where\\'s the charm? where\\'s the charisma, don\\'t mention that attempt at the piano please.<br /><br />Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don\\'t either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate \\'Thieves Highway\\' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.<br /><br />I\\'ll finish on a song:<br /><br />Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don\\'t believe you You\\'re not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercy<br /><br />Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn\\'t help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me<br /><br />Pretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you\\'ll stay with me..and I\\'ll pay you..I\\'ll treat you right\"\\n211,\"This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. I cannot recommend this movie. Where did this movie come from? This movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including: Gary Sinise, Kathy Bates, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jennifer Tilly.\"\\n212,\"I strongly dislike this show. I mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and I doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. And why do they suddenly allow girls into the school?

She is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.<br /><br />and shouldn\\'t chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really! None of this show is real life, and she isn\\'t \"\"a girl like me\"\" because majority of the regular girls do NOT go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do NOT live by the beach.<br /><br />fake fake fake.\"\\n213,\"Normally I don\\'t like series at all.

Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there\\'s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan\\'s, hes pure in everyway. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece\"\\n216,\"I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shorter version. James McNally\\'s summary of the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity.<br /><br />The film is shot on hand-held DV which some might find offputting, but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.<br /><br />Despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world\\'s dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees\\' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. To a degree this evoked Michael Moore\\'s recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls\\' \"\"The Sorrow and the Pity\"\", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of \\'salt of the earth\\' French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards. We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert!<br /><br />Overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world.\"\\n217,\"I can\\'t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />In a no-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />This film should be avoided at all costs. It\\'s one of those \"\"festival films\"\" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it \"\"different\"\", therefore good.<br /><br />Bad film-making is not \"\"different\"\", it\\'s just bad film-making.\"\\n218,\"This movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.<br /><br />This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by Johns plan. However a glitch turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.<br /><br />What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message \"\"you would have probably acted likewise\"\".<br /><br />Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, \"\"almost\"\" only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.<br /><br />The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you\\'re in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of the \"\"rude awakening\"\" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society\\'s machine, the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings (\"\"Welcome to the machine!\"\"). I bet that in the end, John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.<br /><br />Thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, I am sure of it.\"\\n219,\"Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any young<br /><br />aspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using to<br /><br />line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this<br /><br />movie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to<br /><br />make your toward your TV set\\'s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.\"\\n220,\"This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. <br /><br />The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it\\'s really a \"\"chick flick\"\" and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network.<br /><br />There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By halfway through, they had lost me. <br /><br />By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here.\"\\n221,\"I think this movie has got it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. IS REALLY funny(you know, the kind that you\\'ll crack up on the ground and you\\'ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).Despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times.<br /><br />There are so many funny parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison\\'s attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. On that part, I kept saying \"\"Remember, Remember?\"\"to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his \"\"Strange dream\"\" and how he was \"\"Superman\"\". I LOVED that part, although it has been a while since I saw it, so I don\\'t remember that part. Everything the actors said were funny, like how Kurt says, \"\"I worship you, like a GOD!\"\" to the robot.<br /><br />Although there was some bad things, in all it was a GREAT movie. Man, I can\\'t stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );\"\\n222,\"Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at the high school in a small Indiana city. He is finally getting married to Emily (Joan Cusack), much to his parents delight. The town is abuzz, too, because one of its own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, is watching the Academy Awards on television as Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, in part, because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. You guessed it, its Howard! But, Howard has never \"\"come out\"\"; in fact, he believes he is straight! With the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and observing the happenings, will Howard and Emily go ahead and get married? Or, is Howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. As the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is equally fine, with Cusack a stitch as the mixed-up fiancé and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck, and others on hand to delight the audience as well. The costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely Indiana heartland is beautiful. Then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. But, the insightful, humorous, and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film\\'s best asset, no doubt. For those who would be offended by a gay-themed film, yes, just skip over this one. But, for everyone who wants to laugh heartily, and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film out there.\"\\n223,\"When the opening shot is U.S. Marines seriously disrespecting the U.S. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. There is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired U.S. Marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. The U.S. government is still finding the missing from WWII, and it takes months to identify the remains. Military shot down remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark, but not in the U.S. Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the U.S. military.<br /><br />Beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. Having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from Cliffs Notes. There\\'s no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. Either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.\"\\n224,\"We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America\\'s own Imperial age.<br /><br />America\\'s projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (Politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of \"\"native\"\" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.<br /><br />Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery\\'s noble brigand, Candace Bergen\\'s feisty heroine, John Huston\\'s wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly\\'s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt\\'s \"\"Big Stick\"\". There is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing Moor on his white steed. This is high adventure at its best.\"\\n225,\"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it\\'s raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT.<br /><br />Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn\\'t care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy\\'s character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn\\'t feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn\\'t really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.\"\\n226,\"One of Starewicz\\'s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz\\'s films. The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on Starewicz\\'s old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and people\\'s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewicz\\'s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil\\'s club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.\"\\n227,\"Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, I\\'m probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn\\'t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own \"\"thing\"\" that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn\\'t go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn\\'t try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.\"\\n228,\"Prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. The inspectors at Scotland Yard, Higgins(IJoachim Fuchsberger)and his superior Sir John(Siegfried Schürenberg)certainly have their hands full with this case. It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY\\'s finest must figure out. The staff of the girls\\' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. It\\'s a clever scheme where a driver, Greaves(Günter Meisner)meets the convicts(..who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. Under suspicion are girls\\' dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the Bannister. Some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. The ending features multiple twists. <br /><br />Out of the Krimi films I\\'ve seen, THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it\\'s colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind\\'s secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isn\\'t used), the fake bible/water pistol, when opened, fires the gas into the face of startled victims, the Greaves\\' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat, and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling, buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins\\' abilities to get at the truth(..perhaps poking fun at know-it-all British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)..I felt he was used as comedy relief, particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims, often misunderstanding what are told to him. Higgins, using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator, instead follows the clues/facts, often avoiding Sir John as much as possible. Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed, and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect, any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls\\' executions. I\\'d say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)examples of the Krimi genre, for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it\\'s sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening(..and, you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off).\"\\n229,\"I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. Character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. This is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. I am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.\"\\n230,This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. There\\'s a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. The whole thing is just laughable.\\n231,\"I think this is one hell of a movie...........We can see Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal movies there\\'s a message in it, without the message it would be one of many action/fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special.\"\\n232,\"I saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. Then again, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she is today. Anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship films. How far would you really go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end, and still tear up when I watch it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her. This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend. However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you\\'d do something like that for her....\"\\n233,\"I\\'ve seen this film literally over 100 times...it\\'s absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the \"\"intensity\"\" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I\\'m concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones...this film captures his best performance!!!\"\\n234,\"The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good Harry, to no avail.<br /><br />Then there\\'s the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel\\'s moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is doing half a monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man.<br /><br />Time and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it\\'s hard to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn\\'t have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right.<br /><br />This movie is strange, but then so am I; no wonder I liked it.\"\\n235,\"Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. She appears like a fresh scrubbed face \"\"tween\"\" slight and stringy, but undeniably Reese.<br /><br />I have always liked her as an actor, and had no idea she started this young with her career, go figure. I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on. I say that because whenever I have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact.<br /><br />Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed that was her first time up \"\"at bat\"\" Not so, well done Reese\"\\n236,This game ranks above all so far. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2 so the graphics were really good. The voice acting was above standard. The difficulty level is just right. Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story amazed me and took many different twist that I wasn\\'t expecting. The only rating this game deserves is great.\\n237,\"This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn\\'t have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director\\'s spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie. Do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! Buy the CD, if you must. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it is better then the movie.\"\\n238,\"This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. It\\'s certainly all been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special.<br /><br />What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. She\\'s married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson who\\'s the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. That doesn\\'t sit well with either Dianne Foster who is Robinson and Stanwyck\\'s daughter, nor with Lita Milan who is Keith\\'s Mexican girl friend.<br /><br />The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but Glenn Ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. He\\'s every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford\\'s mouth, \"\"I\\'m a peaceable man.\"\" Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men.<br /><br />The Fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn\\'t been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford would do another western, Jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.<br /><br />There\\'s enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.\"\\n239,\"Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word \\'apparently\\' because without listening to a director Andy Copp\\'s commentary (which I didn\\'t have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won\\'t have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they\\'re also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they\\'ll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one\\'s sanity: if you\\'ve still got all your marbles, you\\'ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I\\'m completely barking!).\"\\n240,\"This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn\\'t even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs \"\"Sini Ne\"\" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesn\\'t have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.\"\\n241,\"I Feel the Niiiiiight Heat! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART-beat! Something ain\\'t right!\"\" Theme song written by B.J. Cook from Skylark- David Foster\\'s old band and wife. She also wrote the memorable theme from CBC\\'s \"\"Airwaves.\"\" OH Night Heat! What a program! Well-written, well-acted and totally classic. Crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. I\\'d like to think this is really what detectives do/did. Giambone was a real favourite! On a Canadian tip, I learned EVERY Canadian actor\\'s name and style from guest spots done on Night Heat. Everyone passed through the Night Heat set and like Law & Order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.\"\\n242,\"This movie fails miserably on every level. I have an idea, let\\'s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. Maybe if we\\'re lucky they\\'ll all be shot and killed and we won\\'t have to ever have our time wasted by them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? My god, I can\\'t think of anything I\\'ve ever seen that was this bad. I\\'d rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, I\\'ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. That\\'s my two cents.\"\\n243,\"Yes i\\'ll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.<br /><br />The acting was good (apart from Thewlis)<br /><br />Stone really has a talent with this role. She\\'s slick, naughty and seductive and doesn\\'t look a day older than she did in the first.She really impressed me(like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. He really sucked.<br /><br />Overall, this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.\"\\n244,\"Based on a Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, AT THE EARTH\\'S CORE provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest. A Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry(Peter Cushing)invents a giant burrowing machine, which he and his American partner(Doug McClure)use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters.<br /><br />Cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying. Instead of being a bold adventurer, he comes across effeminate. On the other hand McClure overacted enough to make himself also laughable. Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.\"\\n245,\"I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops. Brilliant Film.\"\\n246,\"This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn\\'t the smart thing to do be to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something about it... But every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. Once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And you\\'d think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn\\'t you? Yay! We\\'ve solved the murder! Now like every other week, let\\'s go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. There is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.\"\\n247,\"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la \"\"For Your Consideration\"\"). The \"\"cliffhanger\"\" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young\\'s terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can\\'t believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.\"\\n248,\"Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she\\'s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep\\'s work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don\\'t know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty good film. A bit different. Grade: B\"\\n249,\"\\'Airport 4\\' is basically a slopped together mess for Universal Studios to try and work a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - into their \\'disaster-in-the-sky\\' formula.<br /><br />Bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy sticks his hand out of Concorde\\'s window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft\\'s flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon, and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /><br />Not really related to the other \\'Airport\\' films.\"\\n250,\"Supposedly a \"\"social commentary\"\" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970\\'s, \"\"Nightmare\"\" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised \"\"babe in prison\"\" movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There\\'s also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of \"\"Gilligan\\'s Island\"\") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. <br /><br />\"\\n251,\"OK, I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.<br /><br />But we decided it to watch it anyway. Just for hilarity purposes.<br /><br />And I\\'m sorry, but this has got to be, one of THE worst films in history.<br /><br />It began off alright, and we thought \"\"Ok this might actually be OK\"\". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken.<br /><br />It began when the \"\"mysterious paint baller\"\" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser/Australian (I say that because he had an accent which couldn\\'t be identified), who\\'s acting might I just say, was abysmal.<br /><br />Then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. The paint ball finals.<br /><br />The only thing I did like about this plot is that they didn\\'t actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default.<br /><br />And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. Critical Damage. I mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like \"\"The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ\"\" or something. Or that\\'s what the film should of been called anyway.\"\\n252,\"Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80\\'s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! \"\"The Brain\"\" takes place in a typical quiet-American town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TV-guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. Under the label of \"\"independent thinkers\"\", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it\\'s up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that\\'s about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There\\'s not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the \"\"evil\"\" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made \"\"Bloody Birthday\"\" (guilty pleasure of mine) and \"\"Plague\"\". Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she\\'s obviously a great talent\\x85 She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her \"\"masterpiece\"\". In her debut, she was credited as \\'runaway model\\' and in \"\"3 men and a baby\"\", her character is referred to as \\'one of Jack\\'s girls\\'. I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress\\x85\"\\n253,\"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :<br /><br />\"\" It\\'s about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner \"\" <br /><br />\"\" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? \"\" <br /><br />\"\" We\\'re using a new angle . My family don\\'t get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same \"\" <br /><br />This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It\\'s a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn\\'t down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained <br /><br />Bronson is a retired hit-man who isn\\'t giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of \"\" The Doctor \"\" , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It\\'s never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents <br /><br />As you may guess it\\'s a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like The Doctor\\'s sister being a lesbian so some T&A can be included <br /><br />In many ways it\\'s like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons . Believe me this movie won\\'t be shown until well after the watershed\"\\n254,\"Well, here\\'s another terrific example of awkward 70\\'s film-making! The rudimentary premise of \"\"What\\'s the matter with Helen?\"\" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it\\'s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! In the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington (\"\"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\"\") and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (\"\"Hush\\x85Hush\\x85Sweet Charlotte\"\") in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there\\'s a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930\\'s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. We\\'re literally catapulted back to the 1930\\'s, with a sublime depiction of that era\\'s music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. There\\'s never a dull moment in \"\"What\\'s the matter with Helen\"\", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters. She\\'s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who\\'s about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees\\' and Michael Myers\\' combined! There are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies\\' house. There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an Oscar!) are breathtaking.\"\\n255,\"Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can\\'t blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.<br /><br />It didn\\'t get much better. I\\'ll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don\\'t even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). People flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It\\'s as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll try watching the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I\\'m sure you do, too. Skip this.\"\\n256,\"I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. It\\'s one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can\\'t turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it\\'s good and so bad it\\'s, well, just plain BAD, it\\'s worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it\\'s both! Great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Don\\'t even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.\"\\n257,\"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick \"\"Doppelganger\"\" (an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a \\'counter-Earth\\' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it.<br /><br />Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a \\'made for TV\\' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man\\'s John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the \\'World Order\\' on counter Earth.<br /><br />But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.<br /><br />I\\'ll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (\"\"Doppleganger\"\"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.<br /><br />In \"\"Stranded in Space\"\", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn\\'t even shaking the camera or the set). I\\'ve seen episodes of \"\"The Twilight Zone\"\" and \"\"The Outer Limits\"\" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity.<br /><br />And that, in essence, is what\\'s wrong with \"\"Stranded In Space\"\". No budget, no time, no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys\\' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn\\'t work. <br /><br />I\\'m sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that\\'s what you, the viewer will do. You\\'ll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called \"\"Stranded In Space\"\", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can\\'t recall too much about it.\"\\n258,\"Black comedy isn\\'t always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don\\'t often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. There doesn\\'t seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987.<br /><br />DeVito plays an odd mamma\\'s boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but he clearly doesn\\'t have the guts to actually do it himself. That\\'s where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen\\'s creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. \"\"The night was....\"\" Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai\\'i and murder Larry\\'s ex-wife. Once it appears he has done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It\\'s certainly never dull and often full of surprises.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isn\\'t too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.\"\\n259,\"Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents\\' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn\\'t have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents\\' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents\\' family homes and through inheritances from relatives\\' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks\\' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I\\'m still sore.<br /><br />Way to go, FX.\"\\n260,\"Paul Verhoeven\\'s predecessor to his breakout hit \\'Basic Instinct\\' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there, he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn\\'t happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you\\'ll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I\\'ve mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man isn\\'t anything to write home about, but it\\'s solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience\\'s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven\\'s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it\\'s a shame that he doesn\\'t put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I\\'ve seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it\\'s worth the effort.\"\\n261,\"I accept that most 50\\'s horror aren\\'t scary by today\\'s standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast. Instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on Earth....yeah which is what the people wanted.<br /><br />The overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast....but the title really kills the movie. Night of the Beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn\\'t any blood to speak of.<br /><br />I like how the 50\\'s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one. This movie isn\\'t the worst i\\'ve ever seen but its almost up there.<br /><br />2 out of 10\"\\n262,\"Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don\\'t even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend\\'s house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. It\\'s just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole \"\"story\"\" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I\\'ve seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!!!) (shudder) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.<br /><br />Fun fact: This film is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of scary huh?\"\\n263,\"There is a difference between a \"\"film,\"\" and a \"\"movie.\"\" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.<br /><br />On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski\\'s \"\"Donnybrook.\"\" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the \"\"finished\"\" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie. And a student movie, at that. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, which is to say, the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.<br /><br />Granted, there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written, engrossing story and some sharp dialog. Steven Soderbergh\\'s \"\"sex, lies, and videotape\"\" comes immediately to mind. This movie, however, has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father, then I feel this movie misses the point. What I got out of it is that Davie\\'s main aspiration is to \"\"change the face of rock \\'n\\' roll.\"\" However, we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time, SHOW don\\'t TELL the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, Davie doesn\\'t look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970\\'s; he looks like he\\'d be more comfortable in the early days of rock \\'n\\' roll, posing as James Dean\\'s less talented brother. In the meantime, the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters, and story threads, that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving Terry\\'s father). If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction, I will consider watching \"\"Napolean Dynamite\"\" again, a film I could barely make it through the first time.<br /><br />As for the above mentioned dialog scenes, I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between. Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? I don\\'t think it is. When the characters do speak, it is in short, choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, Al Hudson\\'s, and that\\'s just because he\\'s doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director, would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. However, with Satejowski being so close to the material, he simply doesn\\'t see them, or, if he does, he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it\\'ll hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner, is the mark of a self-indulgent, misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /><br />In the end, we are left with a poor, high-school-set, knock-off of Zach Braff\\'s amazing \"\"Garden State\"\" combined with the equally amazing \"\"Velvet Goldmine,\"\" two films far more worthy of your time.<br /><br />Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review, allow me to offer this. The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. However, the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the movie holds any promise (and let\\'s face it, at this point, it isn\\'t going to come from the acting, writing, or directing), it is this: If, IF, the people associated with this film are willing, then, please, learn from this movie, file it away, and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; don\\'t attack your critics, or have friend or family do it for you. If you are able to do this, maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a \"\"film.\"\"<br /><br />I am your audience, and I am willing to watch.\"\\n264,\"please re-watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min TV episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life, truly an awful film. tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns, also mr briss\\'s accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras, and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god-awful piece of crap..........batman and robin all is forgiven\"\\n265,\"Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs.

The director says \"\"The places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness.\"\" The non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. It has won the Jury Grand Prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it\\'s near-perfect. WHERE, where can I get hold of it?\"\\n266,\"Sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. If you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... This (unfortunately) was not the case with \"\"Satan\\'s Whip\"\".<br /><br />Written and directed by Jason Maran, \"\"Satan\\'s Whip\"\" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. I\\'m guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and I found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. The story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made \"\"Satan\\'s Whip\"\" one to forget quite quickly. I will give it a \"\"4\"\" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time.\"\\n267,\"Tainted look at kibbutz life<br /><br />This film is less a cultural story about a boy\\'s life in a kibbutz, but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the movie, the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it\\'s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical \"\"kibbutznikim.\"\" Besides the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well\\x85evil. <br /><br />The story centers on how the kibbutz, like some sort of cult, slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression etc. For example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy \\x96 his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his \"\"jewish\"\" physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn\\'t seen in a long time due to his military service, he orders, Quote \\x96 \"\"Linda, go take shower and I cum in two minutes.\"\" <br /><br />There is one other \"\"good\"\" character in this movie \\x96 a European foreigner who plays the mother\\'s boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother\\'s son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist\\'s arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for \"\"violent\"\" behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18, or without love and gives an account of the actual act that\\'s supposed to be humorous for the audience, but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy\\'s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can\\'t \"\"escape\"\" the kibbutz, although in reality, anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. It\\'s a mystery how the boy\\'s father died, but you can rest assured, the kibbutz \"\"drove him to it\"\" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. <br /><br />That\\'s the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry performances, and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience\\'s head \\x96 that kibbutz life was degrading, miserable and even deadly for those who didn\\'t \"\"fit in.\"\" I feel sorry for the guy who made this film \\x96 obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs.\"\\n268,\"(When will I ever learn-?) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen...<br /><br />I will admit: the setting, presumably New York City, has never been so downright ugly and unappealing. I am reminded that the 70\\'s was a bad decade for men\\'s fashion and automobiles. And all the smoking-! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, it succeeded.<br /><br />For a film to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there has to be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close, and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky. If a stray shot had struck Mikey, well, it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most.<br /><br />I can\\'t remember when I detested a film as strongly. I suppose I\\'m a rube who doesn\\'t dig \"\"art\"\" flicks. Oh, well.\"\\n269,\"\"\"Lost\"\", \"\"24\"\", \"\"Carnivale\"\", \"\"Desperate Housewifes\"\"...the list goes on and on. These, and a bunch of other high-quality, shows proves that we\\'re in the middle of a golden age in television history. \"\"Lost\"\" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a TV-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. Anyone who isn\\'t hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. It may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to watch this. Hope they keep it up (as I\\'m sure they do).\"\\n270,\"Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you\\'ve heard it, you\\'ve heard it and you don\\'t need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film\\'s scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors; it\\'s a pity this film doesn\\'t have any of them in it. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.\"\\n271,\"This is a must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality. Darius Goes West is an amazing roller-coaster of a story. We live the lives of Darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease which affects all the muscles in his body. He is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention. So how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6,000 mile round-trip to the West Coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises!\"\\n272,\"The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. When war finally does arrive, it\\'s ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the \"\"wandering sickness\"\", a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />\"\"Things to Come\"\" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. The \"\"Wings Over the World\"\" concept plays out a bit corny, though it\\'s spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in Massey\\'s end of movie speech. Man\\'s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an \"\"all the universe or nothing\"\" mindset.<br /><br />The film\\'s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film \"\"Metropolis\"\". As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city\\'s rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie\\'s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man\\'s first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />\"\"Things to Come\"\" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? It\\'s not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.\"\\n273,\"Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci\\'s last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci\\'s movies.<br /><br />Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. It\\'s filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. Being Fulci flick, you need to know it\\'s gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it\\'s a hard to archive. Even the Braindead didn\\'t stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about Fulci, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it\\'s wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this IS the goriest Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where Fulci says \"\"making gore movies is kind of a sickness\"\" Ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most of the Italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. If you are fun of the Fulci, make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat \"\"Its only a movie\"\" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: Chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face...\"\\n274,\"What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he\\'s been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico. Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. And you\\'ll never hear another screenplay feature the word \"\"butthorn\"\" either. Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from \"\"Lethal Weapon\"\" and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in \"\"Red Dawn\"\" a few years earlier. After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies. Sadly he\\'ll probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in \"\"Every Which Way You Can.\"\"\"\\n275,I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it\\'s okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it\\'s got a good ending even though I didn\\'t really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings I figured it out over time and that\\'s the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you\\'re watching it the first time.<br /><br />THIS IS BEST MOVIE.\\n276,\"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However, just two years on and I find I can\\'t remember enough about them in order to do it \\x96 I guess they couldn\\'t have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels \\x96 Dream Warriors in particular \\x96 weren\\'t as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn\\'t lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy\\'s Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character\\'s demise. The fact that the movie\\'s conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film\\'s being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund\\'s in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy\\'s mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It\\'s like Englund\\'s crying out \"\"we know this is garbage \\x96 but you\\'re paying to see it, so who\\'s the one laughing?\"\" And I\\'m sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy\\'s appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few \"\"haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr \\x96 har \\x96 har \\x96 hars\"\" and that\\'s it. If this was the only Elm St. film you\\'d ever seen you wouldn\\'t get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written \"\"you\\'re f**ked\"\". When prompted for the map, Carlos responds \"\"well the map says we\\'re f**ked\"\". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin \\x96 a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. \"\"Nice hearing from you, Carlos\"\", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It\\'s also worth noting that dream sleep doesn\\'t occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn\\'t allow instant access into Freddy\\'s world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn\\'t that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with \"\"shut the f**k up, man\"\" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy\\'s Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.<br /><br />\"\\n277,\"Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang isn\\'t really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard-edged action is your thing.<br /><br />Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape\\x97until he meets Yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.<br /><br />A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang\\'s love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Chan-wook Park\\'s Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.<br /><br />Of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.<br /><br />Whilst this film might not be a \\'classic\\' slice of Hong Kong excess, with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals, it\\'s still worth seeking out.\"\\n278,\"I watched this movie for the hot guy--and even he sucked! He was the worst one--well, okay, I have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. The guy wasn\\'t that cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can\\'t stand up to his mom for the one he \"\"loves\"\" there\\'s ever been. Overall, and if this makes any sense to you, when I go to pick up movies at the video store, I think to myself as I read the back of a movie that looks so/so, \"\"Well, at least it can\\'t be worse than Carolina Moon.\"\" The most terrible movie, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot--everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips. It was THE most horrid movie I will ever see, with Gabriela way up there too. I hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under 1 IMDb had for rating, I\\'d choose that in a heartbeat.\"\\n279,\"Absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story. Told with unflinching eye and with gripping style. If you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people, this could change your mind. Something for you feds too: A good model for government coverups! If you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you.\"\\n280,\"I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say. Even though this movie did not get the best comments, this movie made my day. It got me thinking. What a false world this is.<br /><br />What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you. It\\'s said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. Same way some people are such that they are never grateful. This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. <br /><br />A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone.<br /><br />Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show. Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself.<br /><br />A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His movies always give some message to the audience. His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who\\'s novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. They are entertaining as well as lesson-giving.\"\\n281,\"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy \"\"Chainsaw massacre\"\"-feeling, everything falls apart.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these \"\"fooled-ya\"\"-movies can figure this out.<br /><br />This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind.\"\\n282,\"I can\\'t say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but I just couldn\\'t. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I\\'m not one to trash a movie, but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn\\'t even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying, too.<br /><br />Overall, well, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.\"\\n283,\"I am not so old that I can\\'t remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple times. But some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells.<br /><br />From the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. <br /><br />If you ever saw Shakes the Clown you know how unfunny Bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits\\' hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into Hollywood\"\\n284,\"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />\"\"Panic in the Streets\"\" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"\"Pânico nas Ruas\"\" (\"\"Panic in the Streets\"\")\"\\n285,\"The box is why I originally picked up this movie and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been duped. I had thought this movie would be something like a Road Trip/Eurotrip/American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I\\'ve seen in a long time. The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. It appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can\\'t believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DON\\'T BUY IT, DON\\'T RENT IT. Don\\'t waste 2 hours of your life on this.\"\\n286,\"There have been many documentaries that I have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost. But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at the very worst an act of murder. Like most people, when the siege at Waco was occurring I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. After seeing this, I think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the U.S. government through his eccentric actions. Sure, there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site, the clueless testimony of Janet Reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats. Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current U.S. senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I\\'m a Democrat, pretty left-leaning too. After seeing his actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D\\'Amato instead! For anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. I even think this should be shown in classes - it\\'s that important.\"\\n287,\"I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has it\\'s moments I guess you would say. Some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. I won\\'t be putting this movie in my DVD collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting. I guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten\"\\n288,\"Yes, I call this a perfect movie. Not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. It\\'s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress couldn\\'t do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.<br /><br />The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.<br /><br />I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Shadow of a Doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America. The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang\\'s considerably harsher movie Clash by Night, made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.\"\\n289,\"I would like to know if anyone know how I can get a copy of the movie, \"\"That\\'s the way of the World\"\". It\\'s been about 30 years since I\\'ve seen this movie, and I would like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group didn\\'t take off like their counterparts in the early 70\\'s, but as previously stated, racial tension existed in the United States which prohibited equalized exposure for the African American musical groups. It is good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continuing their success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw\"\\n290,\"I saw the movie \"\"Hoot\"\" and then I immediately decided to comment it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and didn\\'t even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that I might harm them actually. (I am currently 15) What so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and Enjoy!\"\\n291,\"I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.<br /><br />This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great \"\"dad\"\".<br /><br />If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.\"\\n292,\"When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But it stuck with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I purchased the Criterion DVD box set, and it turns out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great film. It is rousing, and I\\'m sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the Germans.<br /><br />That is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. It\\'s untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. By now, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein\\'s films as art.\"\\n293,\"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I\\'ve seen a few of his films and he hasn\\'t yet deceived me. Macy is the archetypal \"\"nice guy with something to hide\"\". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, anti-Semite. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight.<br /><br />Unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being Jewish is akin to being an animal.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.\"\\n294,\"In \"\"Brave New Girl,\"\" Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings \"\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\"\" at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end (It seems a sequel could be in the making). Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.\"\\n295,\"Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. Clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi didn\\'t direct it. Although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. It\\'s too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. I don\\'t think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the Pang Brothers.<br /><br />The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other \"\"horror\"\" films, so you\\'ll find absolutely zero original content in \"\"The Messengers.\"\" What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of \"\"Pulse,\"\" a couple that could have come from \"\"The Birds,\"\" one or two from \"\"The Others,\"\" etc. Nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the \"\"surprise ending\"\" long before it comes.<br /><br />Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. I\\'m sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know, so don\\'t be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn\\'t there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? Didn\\'t anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling \"\"Boo!\"\" All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. If there\\'s any message that \"\"The Messengers\"\" delivers, it\\'s \"\"Don\\'t waste your time on this movie.\"\"\"\\n296,\"This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash. There\\'s nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that\\'s it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldn\\'t subject yourself to watching it. I regret it it\\'s very boring. I would rate it zero but i can\\'t. No body in their right mind should see this. i\\'m sure you\\'ll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasn\\'t worth being made. complete waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored.\"\\n297,\"I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn\\'t really in the mood for it at that particular time. It\\'s kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />I\\'m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I\\'m still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian features.<br /><br />It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers\\' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher\\'s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin\\' a smirk that\\'d make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.<br /><br />But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /><br />Darn you, ape man! Efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clichés, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn\\'t bad enough, sometimes you can\\'t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.<br /><br />Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I\\'d have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /><br />Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it\\'s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but had I paid I would\\'ve felt I had gotten my money\\'s worth.\"\\n298,\"Going into see Seven Pounds i wasn\\'t clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All of this comes to an end when the \"\"twist\"\",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to.<br /><br />The acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. Although the casting of the film was still good.<br /><br />This movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. Final thought seven pounds=seven Stars.\"\\n299,\"I saw Brother\\'s Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother\\'s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. Also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.\"\\n300,\"\"\"Mararía\"\" really disappointed me. I can\\'t consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can\\'t really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). Some of the best acting came from a role that wasn\\'t really important to the story, that of Marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. Of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the Canary Islands, and other \"\"wow\"\" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.\"\\n301,\"Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor\\'s nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn\\'t much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.\"\\n302,witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn\\'t think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don\\'t walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it\\'s a win-win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos.\\n303,\"It\\'s a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he\\'s perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman, he\\'s much less comfortable.<br /><br />But his way with an epigram is peerless, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).<br /><br />The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: H&M themselves have blink-and-you\\'ll-miss-\\'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).<br /><br />The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward.<br /><br />Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member.<br /><br />The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to Coward\\'s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It\\'s Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...\"\\n304,\"This is definitely a \"\"must see\"\" film. The excellent Director Alain Chabat (also acting as Ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the \"\"Adventures of Astérix\"\" (the French comic books it\\'s based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) might not get all the \"\"private jokes\"\". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the French way of life, that the fun might be lessened. However, it\\'s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please don\\'t EVER compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : \"\"Astérix et Obélix Contre César\"\" and directed by Claude Zidi.\"\\n305,\"I thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi).<br /><br />Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />Although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />Overall i thought this film was fantastic.\"\\n306,\"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick \"\"Somebody Up There Likes Me.\"\" That movie might be number 1, but \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesn\\'t just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more \"\"gentlemanly\"\" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />\"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the \"\"Gentleman\"\" Jim who really isn\\'t a \"\"gentleman\"\" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT \"\"I can lick any man in the world\"\" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch \"\"Raging Bull\"\" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" is a lot more fun.\"\\n307,\"That this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead. Am I the only one that really saw (rather sleptwalked) through this \"\"film\"\"? This is the only movie I\\'ve ever seen in the theater that I regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it was just that dull. And I even saw \"\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\"\" at the local cinema. From beginning to end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies, cast together by circumstance, who eventually work together as best buddies. The action (what little there is) is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer. Thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our \"\"cinema\"\" that there\\'s no chance for an \"\"Air America 2.\"\"\"\\n308,\"Well, there\\'s no real plot to speak of, it\\'s just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it\\'s not in this case). What else can I say about this...? The action, when happening, is inventive and there\\'s a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there\\'s not much to recommend \"\"Kite\"\". Watch it if you want, but you\\'re not missing much if you skip this one...\"\\n309,\"This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven\\'t seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts, we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet T-shirt contests quite frequently, the story is just laughably idiotic, and the film takes itself much too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa?<br /><br />But it has a few things going for it. Bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.\"\\n310,\"Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we\\'re all different, `Made of different clay,\\' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that\\'s the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets\\' committed-- and obsession, in `Committed,\\' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story.<br /><br />\\tAdmittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She\\'s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it\\'s forever. The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he\\'s gone; off to `find\\' himself and figure it all out. When Joline realizes he\\'s not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. Maybe it\\'s because of that `clay\\' she\\'s made of. Regardless, she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him, which she does-- in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space\\' and not even letting him know she\\'s there. She considers Carl as being in a `spiritual coma,\\' and it\\'s her job to keep a `spiritual vigil\\' over him until he comes to his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen\\'s `Grampy,\\' (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. For Joline, it\\'s a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself.<br /><br />\\tThere\\'s a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. We see it from Joline\\'s point-of-view, as Krueger makes us privy to Joline\\'s thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. That, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. There\\'s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.<br /><br />\\tHeather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation. She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable-- and Graham succeeds on all fronts. Her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it\\'s all a part of the character she creates; there\\'s an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. She\\'s a likable, agreeable person, and because you\\'ve shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It\\'s a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life.<br /><br />\\tAs Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging, as well. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. She is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life.<br /><br />\\tOverall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline\\'s brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.<br /><br />\\tThe supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl\\'s Editor), and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we\\'re going and what we really need-- `Committed\\' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.\"\\n311,\"Ho-hum. An inventor\\'s(Horst Buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son(Luke Perry)has been working on the antedote all along. Enter CIA agent Olivia d\\'Abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins. Also in the cast are:Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d\\'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.\"\\n312,\"Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible seal. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation. Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. This is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to wreck them with \"\"funny\"\" comments.\"\\n313,\"This movie is stupid. There\\'s no getting around it. But so is Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is significantly more funny than this. However, I for one love seeing stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. Call me callous, but see this movie, and you\\'ll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.\"\\n314,\"I was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I\\'ve ever spent at the cinema.<br /><br />In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why I\\'m rating this a 4.<br /><br />In this version, Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as \"\"not just wicked, but vulgar.\"\" <br /><br />There\\'s also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me; Sara\\'s father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset. While the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn\\'t leave you thinking, \"\"Oh puh-leeze.\"\"<br /><br />About the only things true to the book were:<br /><br />1. Sara\\'s father being a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father (\"\"Are you learning me by heart?\"\"/\"\"No. I know you by heart. You are inside my heart.\"\") 3. Sara\\'s friendship with Becky, and her \\'adopting\\' Lottie (although this last one wasn\\'t developed as much as it could have been) 4. The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that\\'s about all that is.<br /><br />People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.<br /><br />If all you want is a \\'feel-good\\' family film, then this delivers. If you\\'re looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact, if you\\'ve read the book) don\\'t waste time with this one. It\\'s such a shame; with a cast like this, if they\\'d stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.<br /><br />Am I harping on about \\'read the book\\' this and \\'read the book\\' that a little too much? Very probably. But if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.\"\\n315,\"as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. TV told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we all made over $100 a day when $20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for NL $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos. i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll. instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all. i was only homeless cause i didn\\'t wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside. anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs. im no longer homeless, am now in govt housing for $177 a month and getting SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI. glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping, worrying about getting caught by security are finally over. had this TV crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner. its a shame how they don\\'t better select who they pick.\"\\n316,\"i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn\\'t sure that i was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.<br /><br />however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.<br /><br />this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worth a chance. if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn\\'t for you\"\\n317,\"Having been a Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting Marine Corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film centers on one recruit who doesn\\'t seem to \"\"get with the program.\"\" A more recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.\"\\n318,\"Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.<br /><br />The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what\\'s going on and you really want to view it for the second time. But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.<br /><br />A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.<br /><br />If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don\\'t forget to switch the light off.<br /><br />My points on different aspects:-<br /><br />Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10<br /><br />Total = 9/10\"\\n319,\"Ken Burns\\' \"\"Baseball\"\" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball\\'s early years and heroes. There\\'s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.<br /><br />18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It\\'s clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his \"\"nine inning\"\" concept. It\\'s not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. Isn\\'t baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he\\'s sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the series\\' theme song, and manages to play \"\"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\"\" so many times you might vomit. We get it, dude.<br /><br />Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls head over heels in love with Buck O\\'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly O\\'Neil waxes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense...<br /><br />Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. \"\"Baseball\"\" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There\\'s no crying in baseball.\"\\n320,\"\"\"Quitting\"\" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents\\' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.<br /><br />But what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No clichés, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /><br />Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He\\'s a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he\\'s the \"\"cool\"\" actor, idolized by youth. \"\"He was hot in the early nineties.\"\" \"\"He always had to be the most fashionable.\"\" He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends--and roles, But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- \"\"I didn\\'t know how to act\"\" \"\"I felt like a phony\"\"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. He says \"\"I had to get high to do what director wanted.\"\" So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /><br />Hongshen\\'s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic, but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. \"\"I started to open up\"\" he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer\\'s positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. <br /><br />Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and TV, and bangs his head till bloody against his \"\"John Lennon Forever\"\" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he\\'s the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John\\'s son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his \"\"Mother Mary\"\" as an intercessor in his \"\"hour of darkness\"\" and \"\"time of trouble.\"\" (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) \"\"Music is so much more real than acting\"\" he says. And speaks of Lennon\\'s influence as \"\"showing me a new way.\"\" In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon\\'s presence, as does Hongshen\\'s need to re-hang his hero\\'s poster in his redecorated room.<br /><br />If Lennon\\'s influence is spiriting, Hongshen\\'s father\\'s influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen\\'s differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he\\'s Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It\\'s this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: \"\"all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit.\"\" And to Hongshen\\'s emphatic \"\"you are NOT my father,\"\" he softly replies, \"\"why can\\'t a peasant be your father?\"\" <br /><br />Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. \"\"You are just a human being\"\" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once \"\"rare and true friendships\"\" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: \"\"it\\'s a good chance to think about my life.\"\" And I might add, become a New Actor, one bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.\"\\n321,\"I have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it\\'s homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. Great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.I confess I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas day, the nicest present I could have had.\"\\n322,\"If only I had read the review by Alex Sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw \\'Alien versus Predator\\'. It too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.<br /><br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU.<br /><br />Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldn\\'t here.<br /><br />A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) I would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.<br /><br />An edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con\\'s brother by the way. Yes they\\'re clever these director brothers whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC, Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.<br /><br />Guess what happens next? I won\\'t tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-ridden universe.<br /><br />The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late. The Aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked alright. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. It\\'s filmed and paced badly. It\\'s acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you. If you haven\\'t seen it then well please make your own decision.<br /><br />PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?\"\\n323,\"Even though I saw this film when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prison.<br /><br />Apart from the liberty taken right at the end, the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. The temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that.<br /><br />Of the performances, There is scarcely a poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good is Stanley Baker as the Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always.<br /><br />Because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family.\"\\n324,\"Gone is the wonderful campiness of the original. In place is a c-grade action no-brainer, wich is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original. All the meaningless sex and violence is gone, and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers. See it, but don\\'t expect the thrills of the first.\"\\n325,\"Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.<br /><br />This being said, this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies. It\\'s plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for Ealing Studios--which had a particular fondness for \"\"little\"\" films like this one.<br /><br />Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. He wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work! So, he tends to sneak into labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand at inventing. Repeatedly, he is caught (such as after he blew up the lab) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, unions, the government and people in general.\"\\n326,\"Victor McLaglen\\'s performance is one of the finest in film history.<br /><br />I think we can all feel for \"\"Gypo\"\" because we\\'ve all struggled with what is right and what isn\\'t and been wrong. This was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major American movie studio (RKO Radio Pictures).<br /><br />Joseph H. August\\'s cinematography is at its very best here. However, August\\'s stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn\\'t receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved.<br /><br />This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible.\"\\n327,\"How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this, you\\'d think it couldn\\'t be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they\\'re planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he\\'s a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It\\'s utterly unbelievable and \"\"B movie\"\" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don\\'t waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.\"\\n328,\"The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It\\'s peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.<br /><br />Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with Monica Gayle\\'s screen presence, makes Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. The film never drags and you won\\'t have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button.\"\\n329,\"What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. This is the type of film that I\\'ve been looking for ages. Particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking Chicago, which I still keep thinking about. The back cover doesn\\'t do this film justice, it\\'s superb, and in my top-5 for sure.\"\\n330,\"I did not expect much from this film, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be this bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good act here, you can\\'t get the feeling that his caracter is real, I think the movie would have been a bit better if it\\'s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved. The movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it. In the \"\"making of\"\" they don\\'t show a single smile. This is a very bad film! I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but I did never laugh!\"\\n331,\"I cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen. It my have been b/c i am Mel Brooks biggest fan... I know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them, when it is played on a Family Channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so i dont know why any one would disagree! thanks Kristina\"\\n332,\"Flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. Playing real-life boxing champ Jim Corbett, Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith. He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. The next day, he gets a chance, via Smith, to gain entrance to the judge\\'s private club. He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club\\'s resident boxer. His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.) Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. He looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn. At this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. Bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn\\'s manager. The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn\\'s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types. The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. A few of the sets are amazingly presented. Some of Smith\\'s gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. It\\'s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it\\'s also so much more. Some of it (like the character traits shown by Flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) One line is particularly memorable: \"\"I believe you like me more than I like you, but it\\'s entirely possible that I love you more than you love me.\"\" It\\'s classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.)\"\\n333,\"Often laugh out loud funny play on sex, family, and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it\\'s seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. Plot centers on two chauffers who\\'ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer (both single or soon to be single ladies, quite sexy -- Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses, he must play bottom man to his friend! <br /><br />Lots of raunchy dialogue, fairly sick physical humour, etc. But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy, teenaged niece on a year long \"\"missionary trip\"\" to Africa.<br /><br />Hilarious fun.\"\\n334,\"Thought provoking, humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war. A small, but altruistic view of one family\\'s interactions with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This movie lessens the \"\"glamor\"\" of war; showing it\\'s effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit.<br /><br />A lot of today\\'s movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the \"\"hero\\'s\"\" and other glamorous features of war, but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community. This movie attempts this through a retelling of a person\\'s memory of those days. This movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events, when in reality, this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of \"\"actual events\"\" during the civil war. I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.\"\\n335,\"Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90\\'s flicks?<br /><br />I mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. Med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. Bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies. Sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts.<br /><br />Noble idea totally fubarred in it\\'s execution.\"\\n336,\"elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies, it has every thing you would want in a film, like great one liners, sexy star and a Outrageous story! if you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest films made. i can\\'t wait till her new movie comes out!\"\\n337,\"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl. The photography was beautiful.<br /><br />This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple as Grey Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I am not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave it the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />You can\\'t go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes.\"\\n338,\"Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I\\'d probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood\\'s golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can\\'t recommend this film.<br /><br />The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. The two haven\\'t yet met, but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing. It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it out--especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling!! In hindsight, perhaps I should have just turned it off then! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him back to health. He, in turn, becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her. Despite hardly knowing each other, they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.<br /><br />Once home, however, all isn\\'t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy. The film plays it all for laughs, but frankly Fonda\\'s behaviors were really creepy--spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she treats, tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal away his wife. He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it\\'s all supposed to be for laughs. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order! But, oddly, she gets mad but just can\\'t stay mad at Fonda because he\\'s so........? I can\\'t think of the right word--\\'creepy\\' is all that comes to mind!!! Later, out of the blue, multi-millionaire Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past--so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions. When this job falls through, the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital, giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They don\\'t go any further with the story, but I assume based on Fonda\\'s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients.<br /><br />The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together, nor did the final \"\"Horatio Alger\"\" inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world. They were like three separate plots but despite this, the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a creepy little film! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films.\"\\n339,I find the critique of many IMDb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to GET AWAY from it all.<br /><br />In this case however I have to say it was BAD. I am a SciFi junkie and there was NOTHING in this movie that grabbed me for even one second.<br /><br />There was no proper storyline. I may be an idiot but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so worried about these pieces.<br /><br />The pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. A 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together.<br /><br />This movie was BAD.<br /><br />Dominic\\n340,\"I was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose Inglourious Basterds due to it\\'s amazingly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialog. I got a huge dosage of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. I felt shortchanged. The ratio between violence to plot is very important and I think this movie gets it totally wrong. And the plot? It\\'s that believable or really all that entertaining either. Save your time and money. I can\\'t believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses.\"\\n341,\"Bend it like Beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. It is about a girl called Jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives. i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. The song choices are really good, \\'hush my child, just move on up...to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.\\' Anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review. Bend it like Beckham great flick\"\\n342,\"Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle\\'s living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 60\\'s, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; albeit I enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.\"\\n343,\"Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger\\'s \\'Where the Sidewalks Ends,\\' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel \\'Night Cry\\' by Frank Rosenberg...<br /><br />Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title. \\'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?\\' he asks Andrews. \\'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.\\'<br /><br />Dana Andrew\\'s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...<br /><br />By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of \\'Laura\\' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...<br /><br />Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...<br /><br />The film is one of the best detective films of the 50\\'s, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger\\'s best... <br /><br />Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...\"\\n344,\"In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. Additionally, the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover\\'s son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball\\'s chance in hell. The actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.\"\\n345,\"Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min\\' one that I watched - but I can\\'t fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!<br /><br />I\\'d heard for long about the alleged \"\"shocking\"\" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn\\'t much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it\\'s the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it\\'s tragic.<br /><br />A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that\\'s only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O\\'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I\\'d like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? There, I\\'ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time - period!<br /><br />1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe\"\\n346,\"Did anyone edit this film? Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? It\\'s OK though, I fell asleep watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I\\'ve seen, but it\\'s close. The acting is not the worst I\\'ve seen either...but it\\'s close. The production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life! Not trying to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used some more production.<br /><br />Please don\\'t think I\\'m a hater of horror films, or even that I didn\\'t enjoy this film. I just felt I was laughing at the film much more than I felt I was laughing along with it. The gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.<br /><br />Characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much.<br /><br />I\\'d recommend avoiding this movie.<br /><br />1/10\"\\n347,\"Riding high on the success of \"\"Rebel Without a Cause\"\", came a tidal wave of \\'teen\\' movies. Arguably this is one of the best. A very young McArthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. The story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. The supporting cast is memorable, Frankenheimer directs like an old pro. Just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously.\"\\n348,\"Most of the comments on this movie are positive so I thought I would try and redress the balance. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. I now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. I intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. The 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. In 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as The Godfather. The film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn\\'t enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!)\"\\n349,\"Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all. For le Moko, although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can\\'t leave, because the moment he does, he knows he\\'ll be arrested.<br /><br />Boyer\\'s performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I\\'ll mention two. First was the idea that the police wouldn\\'t enter the Casbah. That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly. So, neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldn\\'t enter, nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. I understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he\\'s shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.<br /><br />This is worth watching for Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10\"\\n350,\"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn\\'t a perfect movie, but I\\'m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don\\'t make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William\\'s body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, \"\"What are you looking at?!\"\" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard \"\"bumbling assistant\"\" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that he\\'s writing his own films, you\\'d think he\\'d give himself a role that he hasn\\'t been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.\"\\n351,\"You should never ever even consider to watch this movie! It is absolutely awful! This isn\\'t an overstatement!! It is so unbelievable and exaggerated, it gets boring. It is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one. They writer hasn\\'t been able to pull it off in a good way.<br /><br />If you\\'d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you, but still, you should plug your ears and just watch. It\\'s not worth listening:p There are so many great movies out there, and if I could choose one, this would be the last movie I would pick. But all in all, it\\'s your choice!!! <br /><br />Enjoy!\"\\n352,\"Tell the truth I’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after having seen it, I was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.<br /><br />I’m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. I’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven’t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin’) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you’re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can’t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes.<br /><br />Cons: Not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/10 (Grade: F)\"\\n353,\"This film held my interest enough to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work.<br /><br />Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Julia\\'s sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parent\\'s murder that she has become mute. Needless to say, Julia\\'s 16-hour days get longer caring for Amanda.<br /><br />Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia.<br /><br />The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other. You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.<br /><br />We discover that Julia\\'s sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.<br /><br />In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually, the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip\\'s location.<br /><br />Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.<br /><br />What struck me about the plot were major holes. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene, with no concern for concealing their identity. The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.<br /><br />The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.\"\\n354,\"Like the previous poster, I am from northern Vermont, and I was inclined to like this film. However, not since \"\"Red Zone Cuba\"\" have I seen such a confusing plot. The things the people to bootleg make no sense. Two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car. Uhm, why? Then they meet two others, and drive up at night in to the bad guy\\'s hideout in a luxury Packard. --Wouldn\\'t just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? Then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! When they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out, of course they\\'re spotted and shot at, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. Again, why? I am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area, all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the U.S. Canada Border Patrol, which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now. <br /><br />And don\\'t get me started on the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years.\"\\n355,MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn\\'t even watch it all it was so bad. This film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot. This was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times. Not even the gore in the film was good. The shootings were fake and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it at the rental store then run the other way. There is nothing good about this film at all. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch Night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head. If you want to see an OK new cheesy movie then watch Scarecrow. I rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. That\\'s how horrible this film really is. THE WORST MOVIE EVER.\\n356,\"Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /><br />The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn\\'t exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S. <br /><br />The film is lighthearted; you\\'ll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. All of the film\\'s characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their \"\"imperfections.\"\"<br /><br />I\\'ve been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because now I\\'m really geeked to give it a try. <br /><br />Watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again.<br /><br />Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is.\"\\n357,\"Recap: Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica. The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica. Julian Rome, a former SETI-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. Soon the object is in the open. The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. It is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, Julian decodes the signal. \"\"Do not open\"\". But too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. The first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. And Washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.<br /><br />Comments: The movie holds a few surprises. One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. It is never really explained why Washington know so much, why Washington is able to command Russian submarines, why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now. It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English. Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose English, why?). But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus, send their \"\"Do not open\"\" message encoded! And finally the end is as open as an end can be.<br /><br />The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.<br /><br />3/10\"\\n358,\"This movie features Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club. Beyond that, it features a truly bad script with dull, unrealistic dialogue. That it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking.\"\\n359,\"Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I\\'d have a couple of hours of my life back. I\\'m frankly suspicious when I see that a film\\'s director also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same guy was \"\"writter and director\"\" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were a few interesting moments (e.g., Judy Tenuta\\'s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. Those moments, however, were few and far between ... and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once I\\'d seen the whole thing. Nope, though I at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later. The \"\"spinning camera\"\" technique was overused and essentially pointless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: \"\"What?!?\"\" or \"\"For goodness sake, get ON with it!\"\" Not recommended.\"\\n360,\"The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country\\'s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I\\'ve seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he\\'s done. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. I don\\'t know about Britain, but America\\'s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government\\'s doings. A gesture in the right direction might help these islanders\\' cause.\"\\n361,\"This flick is so bad its beyond belief.Even for an independent low budget film...it just, well, sucks.I can\\'t even believe even Troma would put out such crap.I have been a fan of some Troma flicks for years(Toxic Avenger,Squeeze Play,Rockabilly Vampire to name a few).But LLoyd, come on,this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste.It features some of the worst acting imaginable.I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good...oh,wait, that is what they did.I mean it,these characters have negative charisma.With any luck, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.As will the special effects people.But beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects,the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.The script is full of plot holes the size of Alaska, and there are severe continuity problems.The worst part however, is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.And this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.But, don\\'t take my word for it.Go out and waste four bucks renting it.Just don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.\"\\n362,\"This is a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she\\'s not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there\\'s anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There\\'s also lots of slick gun-play that\\'s very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn\\'t for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma\\'s cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn\\'t at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /><br />All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.\"\\n363,\"The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there\\'s romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films such as, Singin\\' in the Rain(1952) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner\\'s, The Comic(1969). What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett\\'s film legacy. It doesn\\'t take a genius to realize this movie is a \"\"positive\"\" reworking of Mack Sennett\\'s and Mabel Normand\\'s life. The character Michael \"\"Linnett\"\" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course is Mabel. Sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin(cameo), Roscoe \"\"Fatty\"\" Arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. Not only all that, but Sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. As most film viewers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into that category, it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career started in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director & producer. He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. He had worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers(in Way Up Thar).As film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career, Mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category, and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940\\'s his presence was still felt, e.g. Here Come the Co-Eds(1945)where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack\\'s Wandering Willies(1926)is done. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood, used some of Sennett\\'s Crosby films. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his knack of always associating with the right people, a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show came about later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie\\'s Punctured Romance(1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on TV\\'s, This Is Your Life, then his autobiography, The King of Comedy(1954), which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade, was published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, as he had a cameo in A&C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957, another tribute with the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. In the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. As we get to the silver haired Mack, he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say, \"\"here I am!\"\". When he rises to give a speech a short while later, he is at his most subdued, underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey, \"\"I know my influence on comedy will never end, but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual. Maybe this movie will help.\"\"\"\\n364,\"It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn\\'t get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.<br /><br />Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it\\'s just life. And we\\'re less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don\\'t have to kill the character off to keep the survivor\\'s nobility intact. But that\\'s if Bonanza were done today.<br /><br />But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza\\'s success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.<br /><br />The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br /><br />Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn\\'t care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he\\'d have liked it better in the way I describe.<br /><br />This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /><br />When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.<br /><br />So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn\\'t look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.<br /><br />And if they weren\\'t real, they should have been.\"\\n365,\"Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy, what a terrible film. It\\'s so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it\\'s obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn\\'t sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn\\'t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the \"\"director\\'s cut\"\", or in this case, \"\"let\\'s salvage whatever we can\"\" from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don\\'t know what\\'s going on or why we\\'re watching what\\'s going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone\\'s death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things aren\\'t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There\\'s no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews\\' (and Edwards\\') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It\\'s no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment \"\"I\\'ll give you three guesses\"\" was created just to make fun of Julie\\'s MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned \"\"raunchy\"\" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird\\'s eye view of Julie running towards Hudson\\'s plane, is another \"\"wink\"\" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her \"\"uncle\"\" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I\\'m like \"\"what happened here?\"\"<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where\\'s Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her \"\"uncle\"\" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson\\'s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What\\'s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That\\'s one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it\\'s effect is diminished considerably because it\\'s repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The \"\"Girl in no man\\'s land\"\" is OK even if it\\'s bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn\\'t make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she\\'s on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she\\'s no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.\"\\n366,\"This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.<br /><br />Based on a background of historical events, such as the May 1968 student uprising in France, the decaying Franco regime, the war in Viet-Nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.<br /><br />Generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.<br /><br />The best thing that can be said of this series is Ana Duato\\'s rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar Spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. Indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a TV series. His resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.<br /><br />Not really recommendable for other audiences, even Spanish-speakers in Latin America: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary Spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. It is even probable that certain situations which cause a few Spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers.\"\\n367,\"I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrific! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D\\'Onofrio. I will never look at them the same again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they never could act. Thankfully, only Dan attempted an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read.\"\\n368,\"One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. However, it is seldom every seen on cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.\"\\n369,\"It\\'s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.<br /><br />I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.<br /><br />It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.\"\\n370,\"Of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like the Exorcist, and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this one out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what\\'s going on too. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like \\'black and white cat, black and white cake\\'. Plus, the books are really good as well. I\\'m just sorry that they\\'re not going to turn the second book into a film. It\\'s so scary that it would outdo this movie.\"\\n371,\"This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is \"\"Tom Brown\"\" and his main rival, \"\"Bob\"\" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford--always remembered as the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom\\'s pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />In my opinion, for a better silent college film, try Harold Lloyd\\'s THE FRESHMAN--it\\'s football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others)--and if you\\'ve seen one of these films, you\\'ve seen them all. Well made, but certainly NOT original! And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920!! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone\\'s guess.\"\\n372,\"This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that\\'s holding it back.<br /><br />Awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a let down in practically every other way.<br /><br />An \"\"adaptation\"\" of sorts, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, setting it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let\\'s face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there\\'s one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it\\'s Shakespeare\\'s. So any adaptation, if it\\'s not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.<br /><br />And that\\'s what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. It\\'s the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. Except with guns and in different outfits.<br /><br />Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which I completely tuned out, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go.<br /><br />I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.<br /><br />A shame. An absolute shame.\"\\n373,\"Owen loves his Mamma...only he\\'d love her better six feet under in this dark, laugh-out-loud comedy that both stars and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role.<br /><br />\"\"Throw Momma From The Train\"\" is a terrific comedy, even if it isn\\'t a great film. It\\'s too shallow in parts, and the ending feels less organic than tacked on. But it\\'s a gut-splitting ride most of the way, with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer (DeVito is avid but untalented; Crystal is blocked and bitter).<br /><br />Crystal\\'s Professor Donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunately titled \"\"Hot Fire\"\") and can\\'t write more than the opening line of his next book, which doesn\\'t come easy. He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-type fiction but doesn\\'t know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through; and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs-per-minutes-on-screen, an ascot-wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: \"\"100 Girls I\\'d Like To Pork.\"\"<br /><br />Then there\\'s DeVito\\'s Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner\\'s \"\"star pupil\"\" even though the teacher won\\'t read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a man-child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him \"\"lardass\"\" and other endearing sentiments. In any other movie, we\\'d be asked to feel sorry for Owen, but \"\"Throw Momma From The Train\"\" piles life\\'s cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along. That\\'s one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people.<br /><br />For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and take the rest of what we see here as a lark, it\\'s not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes, asking us to watch in amusement while Owen enlists Professor Donner\\'s help in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner\\'s hated ex, then tells the professor it\\'s his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, \"\"swapping murders\"\" as seen in Hitchcock\\'s \"\"Strangers On A Train.\"\"<br /><br />As a director, DeVito not only complements his actors\\' performances with scene-setting that places the accent on dialogue, he makes some bold visual statements, throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes (and away from taking things too seriously.)<br /><br />Also helping matters is writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter. \"\"You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here.\"\" \"\"She\\'s not a woman...She\\'s the Terminator.\"\" \"\"One little murder and I\\'m Jack the Ripper.\"\" Those are all Crystal\\'s words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context but absolutely kill, are DeVito\\'s and Ramsey\\'s. Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this, according to the IMDb, and that\\'s a shame, because he had real talent for it.<br /><br />The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical \\'coming attraction\\' presentation, the only time I\\'ve seen a movie promoted that way. Owen introduces the professor to his mother as \\'Cousin Patty,\\' and when Momma says he doesn\\'t have a Cousin Patty, panicky Owen loses it. \\'You lied to me,\\' he yells out, slamming the professor\\'s forehead with a pan.<br /><br />Of course, in reality the professor wouldn\\'t groan out something witty from the floor, but \\'Throw Momma From The Train\\' works effectively at such moments, when playing its Looney Tunes vibe for all its worth. DeVito hasn\\'t disappeared from films, of course, but it\\'s a mystery why he hasn\\'t really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie. Maybe it\\'s because, as \\'Throw Momma From The Train\\'s lack of mainstream success shows, his kind of vision isn\\'t to everyone\\'s tastes. That\\'s too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over, and like it.\"\\n374,\"A Compelling Thriller!!, 10 December 2005 Author:littlehammer16787 from United States<br /><br />Just Cause<br /><br />Starring:Sean Connery,Laurence Fishburne, and Blair Underwood.<br /><br />A liberal,though good-hearted Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong is convoked to the Flordia Everglades by unjustly convicted black guy Bobby Earl.Confessing that sadistic,cold-hearted cops vilifyied and beat him to a pulp to get the confession of a gruesome murder of an eleven year old girl.

The premise, about people who\\'s lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, COULD have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film. Instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I\\'m suprised it hasn\\'t been banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well. Oh you figure it out.<br /><br />A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it.<br /><br />If you\\'re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it \"\"a right laff\"\". Everyone else, run, don\\'t walk away from this sorry little misfit.<br /><br />And one question, when the group left the \"\"boring\"\" seaside town (Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film), to go back to Glasgow, WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England?\"\\n376,\"Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s.

Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em\\' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn\\'t sure if Ms. Nipar hadn\\'t wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it\\'s a shame they didn\\'t have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.\"\\n377,\"A truly muddled incomprehensible mess. Most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman\\'s ray gun. And that car!

Grade: F\"\\n378,\"It doesn\\'t happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.<br /><br />George Crile\\'s 2003 best seller, CHARLIE WILSON\\'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely \"\"difference maker\"\" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, \"\"Good Time Charlie\"\" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. It\\'s Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie\\'s Angels.<br /><br />When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, \"\"You can teach \\'em to type, but you can\\'t teach \\'em to grow tits.\"\" No argument there.<br /><br />But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh?<br /><br />Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON\\'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising \"\"Charlie\\'s Team.\"\"<br /><br />The on-screen \"\"Team,\"\" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. He\\'s aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the \"\"Team,\"\" Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score -- both in the Agency\\'s boardroom and in Wilson\\'s bedroom.<br /><br />For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money, lots of money, and eventually \"\"Charlie\\'s Team\"\" covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty stuff.<br /><br />That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma, I wish it weren\\'t so...<br /><br />Even though the initial outcome for \"\"Team Charlie\"\" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely \"\"covert,\"\" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it\\'s like the forerunner to \"\"Mission Accomplished.\"\"<br /><br />As Nichol\\'s film so pointedly points out, \"\"The ball you\\'ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you\\'ve lost interest in it.\"\" Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn\\'t. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn\\'t let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols film).<br /><br />Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best, \"\"We f&%ked up the end game.\"\"<br /><br />Again.\"\\n379,\"I\\'m a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you\\'d expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.<br /><br />If you read the \"\"scholars\"\" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it\\'s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church\\'s fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.<br /><br />There are a few moments where you might cry, \"\"Aha! surrealism!\"\": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in B/W). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm...). If you\\'re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau\\'s early work.\"\\n380,\"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970\\'s \"\"hippie mentality\"\" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in \"\"love\"\" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she \"\"loves\"\" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn\\'t help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she\\'s just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70\\'s is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.\"\\n381,\"This film was pretty good. I am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc.<br /><br />Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was believable, and I love the message. William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.<br /><br />Most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often do not work well. But this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale, even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there.<br /><br />10/10\"\\n382,For his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. The ending is superb. The makers of Blaire Witch obviously watched this film it\\'s ending wasn\\'t an end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and only a piece of Japan\\'s great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.\\n383,This film contain far too much meaningless violence. Too much shooting and blood. The acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor. The only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars.\\n384,\"Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. Also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All of this, so far, is accurate. But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also you\\'d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it.<br /><br />This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate. There may be some truth to that, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hour-long episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.\"\\n385,\"I was truly looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked fun. The idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. First off, there is almost no Froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the Froggg humping a bare breasted chick. Why? On top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. I mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. I wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (Creature from the Black Lagoon stuff), I wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the Froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. Something exciting! Geez, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? My advice to the filmmakers: Keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. Have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!!\"\\n386,\"One of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your \\'score\\'! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE!!!!! Maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise keep away! AND IT IS DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS - THEY WILL PULL THEIR HAIR OUT WITHIN THE HOUR!\"\\n387,\"Chuck Jones\\'s \\'Rabbit Seasoning\\', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I would have to concede that \\'Rabbit Seasoning\\' is the most finely honed script. Here, the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costello\\'s \\'Who\\'s on next\\' routine. As a long term Daffy fan, I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous \"\"Pronoun trouble\"\" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration \"\"You\\'re despicable\"\". As intricate an example of Chuck Jones\\'s impeccable timing as you\\'ll come across, \\'Rabbit Seasoning\\' is a true classic.\"\\n388,\"A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear. Also, alas, an ending that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the auteur has lost interest in the movie, or perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot.\"\\n389,\"\"\"Crossfire\"\" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that\\'s a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene, and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels winds up dead.<br /><br />I don\\'t know about 1947, but seeing \"\"Crossfire\"\" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I don\\'t suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-Semite language.<br /><br />The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - she\\'s a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />Truly excellent, and a must see.\"\\n390,\"AWWWW, I just love this movie to bits. Me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and I am just such a HUGE FAN!!! I hope they bring the TV series out on DVD soon. Come to mention it, I have not see the TV show in a LONG time. Such geart times! Where I come from Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don\\'t know what there missing.<br /><br />The songs in this film are ace the ones I love the most Boys/girls of rock n\\'roll, Diamond Dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry My Mother.<br /><br />This film is sure to excite both young and old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.\"\\n391,\"Skippy from \"\"Family Ties\"\" plays Eddie, a wussy \\'metal\\' nerd who gets picked on. When his favorite wussy \\'metal\\' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead \\'metal\\' idol. He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn\\'t want to take it as far as Sammi does. Which isn\\'t really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, \"\"Rock Star\"\". OK, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from \"\"Family Ties\"\" I haven\\'t a clue. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency, I applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy:Elise Richards gets topless, an a topless extra at a pool party\"\\n392,\"Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy. He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing. So Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check out his biography, you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town, in 1968 to check out locations for \"\"A girl in Australia\"\" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war. You can see his humor in all his movies. I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently. GREAT\"\\n393,\"Goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in VG history. Their is no doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day Bond champ, of its time.<br /><br />This was not a bond game based on material from another medium. This was a completely new; scripted game. Which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) Gameplay was excellent, and if you\\'re a fan of the bond games or films alike, you\\'ll enjoy it.<br /><br />Unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. Which gives it that more cinematic feel. With a very \\'bond\\'-able storyline, you feel like you\\'re in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.<br /><br />Enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. Even after beating the game there\\'s still plenty more to be done. With the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. Despite being quite old now, in video game years. It\\'s still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just thinking about it, I\\'ve got the theme song stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well-written storyline.<br /><br />The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. Superbly done, in true bond fashion. Which can only be named Awesome, Completely Awesome.<br /><br />I\\'ve gotta go throw this game on now. If you haven\\'t played it yet, you\\'re missing out!\"\\n394,Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie. She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. Kenneth Branagh was tolerable. The movie itself was good not exceptional. If you are a Helena Bonham Carter fan it is worth seeing.\\n395,\"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a \"\"thumbs in the middle\"\" review, remarking that I\\'d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I\\'ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br /><br />Everything\\'s wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />And for God\\'s sake...is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see \"\"no character development\"\", above).<br /><br />And to make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1) Joker gasses people.<br /><br />2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3) Batman saves the day.<br /><br />Pfeh.<br /><br />There was one episode I saw that wasn\\'t a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the \"\"Think Thank Thunk\"\" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I\\'ve ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than \"\"I\\'ve Got Batman in My Basement.\"\" <br /><br />I can\\'t really say what I feel this show is because it\\'s probably against the ToS, but it starts with \"\"B\"\" and rhymes with \"\"fastardization\"\". Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days. Stuff that good, and I should have known this, just couldn\\'t possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately.\"\\n396,\"Just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this film you\\'d better have him/her tested. I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad. This \"\"film\"\" is a showcase for digital wizardry AND NOTHING ELSE. The writing is horrid. I can\\'t remember when I\\'ve heard such bad dialogue. The songs are beyond wretched. The acting is sub-par but then the actors were not given much. Who decided to employ Joey Fatone? He cannot sing and he is ugly as sin.<br /><br />The worst thing is the obviousness of it all. It is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible. Great children\\'s movies are wicked, smart and full of wit - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past. But in the continual dumbing-down of American more are flocking to dreck like Finding Nemo (yes, that\\'s right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and eye-crossing trash like Red Riding Hood.\"\\n397,\"\"\"Hey Babu Riba\"\" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed \"\"Esther\"\" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn\\'t always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers\\' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).\"\\n398,\"After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman Jason (Adam Beach) comes to the diner of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day. Among the weird strangers, Jason meets his former sweetheart Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Along the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer.<br /><br />\"\"The Last Stop\"\" could be an average thriller, but the screenplay is simply awful. Most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"\"Encurralados\"\" (\"\"Trapped\"\")\"\\n399,\"This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy\\'s Law being applied to home ownership and construction. If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was set in the \\'simpler\\' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.\"\\n400,\"What can you say about the film White Fire. Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Hilarious? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire. From wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.<br /><br />Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you\\'re about to watch. Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people\\'s attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre \"\"HALT!\"\", and then promptly wastes the mother. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.<br /><br />So now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you\\'re honest about the hero\\'s age) to beautiful Turkey, where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while Bo (masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They don\\'t seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as \"\"you know its a shame you\\'re my sister\"\" he says to her while she\\'s stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.<br /><br />So anyway, there\\'s a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, Fred \"\"the hammer\"\" Williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). All of these things are great, but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire. You may be glad you did..or not.\"\\n401,\"I am so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses. Woody, I\\'ve seen these characters already, I\\'ve seen the storyline from you ten times already. Where did your creativity go??? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change along with it.<br /><br />There are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.<br /><br />When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now I\\'ve come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressing and same old, same old.<br /><br />If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted.\"\\n402,\"This movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. As a Don Knotts vehicle, \"\"The Incredible Mr. Limpet\"\" was much better, with Knott\\'s character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. His performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as Bob Denver did. Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. It was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. John Ritter, whom Knotts worked with in \"\"Three\\'s Company,\"\" was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like \"\"The Dreamer of Oz,\"\" but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in \"\"Pleasantville.\"\" Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in \"\"Airplane!\"\" and \"\"Police Squad.\"\"<br /><br />There\\'s also no way the then-43 year-old Knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the college-age Forrest Gump.<br /><br />The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed TV episode. It\\'s especially evident in the \"\"exterior\"\" scenes of the \"\"town\"\" where Roy goes after he\\'s fired. It\\'s unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the Mayberry-like soundstage artificiality.<br /><br />Even viewing this strictly as a children\\'s movie, it\\'s very disappointing. It\\'s not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. The pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). Movies, even kid\\'s movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. Disney\\'s \"\"The Love Bug,\"\" for instance, at least had some interesting race action.\"\\n403,\"If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called \"\"Outlaw Seas\"\" or \"\"The Outlaw Sea\"\", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world\\'s freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it\\'s difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don\\'t have an office in a real country. Two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway, it\\'s fascinating reading.<br /><br />Horrifying story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble releasing enough Oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.<br /><br />I loved the thoroughly evil performance by Sean Pertwee. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.\"\\n404,\"Gamers: DR is not a fancy made movie, it\\'s more like amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.<br /><br />I\\'m from Hongkong and it\\'s really hard to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I always fancy to be one of the character in the world of D&D. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. You see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; You hear terms like \"\"fighter\"\", \"\"wizard\"\", \"\"hit point\"\", \"\"level\"\", \"\"character\"\", \"\"flaming hand\"\", \"\"Chaotic Evil\"\".<br /><br />What RPG fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software RPG. Gamers: DR provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. The movie goes both gamers\\'s real life as well as in the D&D world. You will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.<br /><br />I don\\'t want to spoil anything, but in short, Gamers: DR is a must watch movie for RPG lovers. For people never play RPG game, I\\'m sure you still get many fun from it.\"\\n405,\"In all honesty, I haven\\'t seen this film for many years, but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can\\'t risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I don\\'t know if it\\'s available on home video or not, but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.\"\\n406,\"This is the only thing I will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked. It rocked hard, and yet it also rocked tasty. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled. Now that tells you something, this filmed rocked even before it STARTED! Now I don\\'t want to give to much away or be a \"\"spoiler\"\" but this movie ROCKED! If you have heard the new album and thought to yourself \"\"this seems a bit substandard Tenacious material,it is like I a merely playing badminton with Satan, what gives?\"\" Then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who would want it better do not know what they want,because better would no longer be the D. This movie is the D period.!So venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked.\"\\n407,\"You\\'d think you\\'re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, going through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.<br /><br />Reda\\'s father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can\\'t drive, and therefore enlists the help of Reda, to his son\\'s protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle.<br /><br />But Reda doesn\\'t see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn\\'t understand. And hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals.<br /><br />The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences.<br /><br />It\\'s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.<br /><br />It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don\\'t miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening\\'s session was still a full house.\"\\n408,\"I watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and I won\\'t make that mistake again.<br /><br />The first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don\\'t see what it is. Flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. When the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn\\'t happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. The only connection these people have is that they have all had a \"\"bad day\"\"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.<br /><br />If this was supposed to be a \"\"Crash\"\" clone, it\\'s a complete failure.\"\\n409,\"A great Bugs Bunny cartoon from the earlier years has Bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store. After he\\'s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he\\'ll be transferring soon. Bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy...and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. Animals like say, a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer. I found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940\\'s. It still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.<br /><br />My Grade: A-\"\\n410,\"I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /><br />1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: \"\" I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo \"\" and \"\" I\\'ll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle\\'s head in my bed \"\" <br /><br />2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won <br /><br />Last year\\'s award ceremony wasn\\'t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn\\'t the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I\\'m sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers <br /><br />Chris Rock wasn\\'t too bad , but he\\'s no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the \"\" minor \"\" Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There\\'s no such thing as a \"\" minor \"\" Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they\\'re as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn\\'t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves <br /><br />Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category <br /><br />Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America\\'s greatest living character actors <br /><br />Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn <br /><br />Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night <br /><br />Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he\\'d never won one . Actually I\\'m glad about this because if he didn\\'t deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn\\'t deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /><br />Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB\\'s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off <br /><br />What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven\\'t done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd\\'s sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts\"\\n411,\"While in a plane, flicking through the large choice of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. oh boy! what a choice.<br /><br />I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride. I don\\'t remember last time I have been so excited, terrified. Not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can\\'t turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you\\'ve got.<br /><br />You will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show. You will drift from thinking \"\"how come the human being can be so vicious\"\" to \"\"why not after all?\"\".Ask yourself would you do it. Then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing. You will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe.<br /><br />Good acting, good directing, with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more.<br /><br />*Spoilers* couple of things i would have changed:<br /><br />- the casting of the contestants. i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him. The idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you didn\\'t care about some of the contestants. Although this might have been done on purpose, i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants. - game rules, a big glitch :<br /><br />what happens if the 5th contestants doesn\\'t die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself!!! they should have given a chance to all contestants to live, ie: if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies.<br /><br />interestingly I haven\\'t been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time. just wish i had some popcorn with me!\"\\n412,\"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell\\'s angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. This movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. Steve\\'s rendition of a dying cat during his \"\"I love what I know\"\" serenade had me vomiting for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying. \"\"You messin\\' wit private stock.\"\" This is scriptwriting folks.<br /><br />I liked the ending. What better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! You have to see this to detest it.<br /><br />DIE Jeter, DIE!!!\"\\n413,\"A rating of \"\"1\"\" does not begin to express how dull, depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is.\"\\n414,\"I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is \\'\\'A good Movie\\'\\'don\\'t be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for \\'\\'once in a life time movies\\'\\'. Keep in mind that many use IMDb for trusted reviews and opinions,don\\'t spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds Peace & love\"\\n415,\"The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune to<br /><br />rent. Unwatchable. Much of the movie is obviously improvised,<br /><br />and not well. It looks like Toback took the first take of<br /><br />everything. The movie gets good for a couple of minutes when<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. shows up, then goes to hell again real<br /><br />quickly.\"\\n416,\"This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn\\'t. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it, and the only reason I did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100.\"\\n417,\"I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. Now I\\'ve see many of them. As special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called \"\" The New House \"\" was one of the most scariest films I ever saw. It was on once in 1972,...I was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, some one should do this one \"\" as is \"\" with no more special efx than the original. This episode was down right creepy as hell. I\\'m lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL \"\" The Haunting \"\" and George C. Scott in \"\" The Changling \"\" . Wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.\"\\n418,\"Okay, I\\'ve watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions. I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic \\'Carmilla\\', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. As the plot of the movie doesn\\'t seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book.<br /><br />Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the \\'General\\' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Laura\\'s condition, and the General?<br /><br />I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I can\\'t be bothered with that. It\\'s called the \"\"this movie doesn\\'t make any sense\"\" game.<br /><br />All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete.<br /><br />It will have to answer such questions as ... <br /><br />* Why can vampires walk around in day light?<br /><br />* Why are they all lesbians?<br /><br />* Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself?<br /><br />* When is the movie a dream and when is it real?<br /><br />* Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn\\'t make anyone bat an eyelid?<br /><br />* Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too?<br /><br />* And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car?<br /><br />* And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car?<br /><br />What the hell is the asylum scene all about?<br /><br />* What the hell is the green goo all about?<br /><br />* Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse?<br /><br />* Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies?<br /><br />* What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?<br /><br />In fact sod it, it\\'s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.<br /><br />I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />\\'Vampires vs Zombies\\' has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?\"\\n419,\"This would\\'ve been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I\\'m Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.<br /><br />Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn\\'t tear my eyes away. This dialogue might\\'ve worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must\\'ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn\\'t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled \"\"weighted score\"\". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn\\'t character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That\\'s a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you\\'ll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.<br /><br />Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male \"\"look-at-me, I\\'m-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man\"\" glory.<br /><br />Don\\'t say you weren\\'t warned.\"\\n420,\"This movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward, attended by two orderlies. The unconscious main character is heard in a voice over, saying that the orderlies are gay. The orderlies kiss. I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny \\x96 it said \\x84comedy\"\" on the DVD case, after all and it goes on like that. Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter, because it is so funny \\x96 and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. While it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn\\'t, this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn\\'t.<br /><br />Brilliant brains can MAKE anything funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that fact. But you have to know the \\x84mechanics\"\", I suppose. Director and co-scriptwriter Dani Levy does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example. Do not get me wrong, some people can MAKE that funny, Dani Levy can\\'t, not for me, anyway.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this movie is that I can\\'t see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships \\x96 if anything they are embarrassing - just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better.<br /><br />The acting is not bad, Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is not really bad either, but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies, leaving the scriptwriting to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!\"\\n421,\"This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. As times goes on, you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.\"\\n422,\"First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It\\'s the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER!<br /><br />How could it fail?<br /><br />There may be spoilers within.<br /><br />First of all, it was dumbed down. Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book...gone. Everything that made you squirm...gone.<br /><br />And then there\\'s the acting. Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. And, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship wasn\\'t addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /><br />You\\'d think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it\\'s like they just don\\'t care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /><br />Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasn\\'t well pulled off. She\\'s a lot less evil and doesn\\'t have the presence as she did in the book. <br /><br />And everything that was left out of the book. The ballon night chase, the marking of Jim\\'s house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. <br /><br />And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn\\'t really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /><br />I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Don\\'t see this movie but read the book. It\\'s a classic of Bradbury.\"\\n423,\"This film is so old I never realized how young looking Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember him playing in a great film, \"\"Lost Weekend\"\". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very rich banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy. They hire a man to pose as a very rich Count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then Penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have every heard, the entire police department and convicts started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film. This is Deanna Durbin\\'s first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.\"\\n424,\"I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a Film Studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.<br /><br />After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent, we viewed on.<br /><br />Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won \\'fantasy of the moment\\' and engaging us directly in an almost \\'I\\'ll find you\\' stalking fashion.<br /><br />Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his co-actor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene. Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.<br /><br />Other than Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head\\'s unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.<br /><br />Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat.<br /><br />We experienced none of Anne\\'s charms crossing the screen. Indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.<br /><br />The crucial kiss, normally our favourite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out. As they moved in closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! <br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.<br /><br />What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of England\\'s finest scenery.<br /><br />Sorry Jane.\"\\n425,\"If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie!! <br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!\"\\n426,\"A rather silly little film you just may love.<br /><br />Although rather corny and cliché at times, it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. Five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy \"\"knowing yours is the best team.\"\"<br /><br />Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughton\\'s first film role after his Dr. Pepper \"\"Be a Pepper\"\" commercials and before his major 1981 hit \"\"American Werewolf in London\"\". Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox gets his first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside of that, no names, but all funny characters.<br /><br />Doubt it has ever made it to DVD, but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. If you do, is worth your watch. You may hate it, but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love.\"\\n427,\"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can\\'t say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn\\'t read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.\"\\n428,\"I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.<br /><br />While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they coaxed to be boring and dull? Either therory wouldn\\'t surprise me.<br /><br />What was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. Either way, they all stunk. Don\\'t watch this film. That\\'s all I can say (unless you\\'re an insomniac).\"\\n429,\"What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before, was strictly for IAN McSHANE.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. He\\'s always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film.... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. These people certainly weren\\'t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them \"\"mailed\"\" their appearances in. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.<br /><br />I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL\\'s performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie.<br /><br />The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. Anybody who expected a clear-cut, by-the-numbers, connect the dots \"\"conclusion\"\" or \"\"answer\"\" at the end of the movie... CLEARLY wasn\\'t watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the \"\"meaning of life\"\" is! The idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did.<br /><br />No car chases... No explosions... No bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and it\\'s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved.<br /><br />****** WARNING...****** If you\\'re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous \"\"question\"\" as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly...<br /><br />YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.\"\\n430,\"Originally harped as a sequel to \"\"The Slumber Party Massacre\"\" series, this film falls flat on it\\'s face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word \"\"massacre\"\" in your film\\'s title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called \"\"Cheerleader Massacre??\"\" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren\\'t all that good. It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. Folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original \"\"Slumber Party Massacre.\"\" 2 out of 10.\"\\n431,\"A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I\\'m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn\\'t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it\\'s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.<br /><br />The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /><br />4/10\"\\n432,\"Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films I have ever seen. In no way, shape, or form would I recommend it to anyone...unless you\\'re trying to put your kids to sleep or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. Why? Days of Heaven\\'s plot is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. The only things working are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story, who talks like a man. I am now dumber for seeing this movie. Don\\'t let it happen to you.\"\\n433,\"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their \"\"Silly Symphonies\"\" series, \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney\\'s \"\"Laugh-O-Gram\"\" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn\\'t really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color.<br /><br />1937\\'s \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" is essentially, a remake of the 1929 classic \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", the movie that borough him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is set on an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that\\'s about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a happy tune. Now, it\\'s not easy to be a musician made of just bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: it\\'s hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves.<br /><br />Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" follows faithfully the pattern set by \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\" years before, although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", although sadly, this doesn\\'t mean it\\'s necessarily a better film. For starters, the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney, with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all.<br /><br />However, it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all, Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". In other words, while DeNat\\'s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, it\\'s easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling\\'s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk\\'s flawless work of animation. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" would be remembered as fondly as \"\"The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking, as it\\'s still a fun film to watch.<br /><br />It\\'s kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney\\'s main rival), he did not lack the quality of those companies\\' films. It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disney\\'s mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney. Despite its shortcomings, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can\\'t help but thinking of \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that Iwerk\\'s skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us.<br /><br />8/10\"\\n434,\"Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It\\'s a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.\"\\n435,\"You wear only the best Italian suits from Armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. Your automobile is the finest that German engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You\\'re a member of the finest polo clubs, frequently dine at restaurants such as Spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. You snow ski in the Alps, go deep sea diving in the Caribbean, sky dive over the Andes, and all the while your hair is never, ever, out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world\\'s most renown spy, favorite son of the good Queen, bad boy of the British SS, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming, and is the movie industry\\'s longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades. The latest man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996, and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye.<br /><br />This is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. Its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it.<br /><br />Let\\'s face it -- most of the time movie-licensed games are flops. Although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the Star Trek flops, are ammunition enough against this mix. And for the record I am not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if I\\'ve seen the movie. At least that\\'s how I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than normal. While not a bad movie, Goldeneye the film didn\\'t have that much appeal to it, and I don\\'t rank it in the top ten amongst Bond movies. As a game, however, let\\'s just say it\\'s a completely different story.<br /><br />The game is a first-person shooter, and in order to be successful, you\\'ll need at least as much brains as brawn. For those who have seen the movie, which I imagine is most of you reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. A plot to control the world\\'s most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, has begun in the USSR, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. Your missions will be many, the danger extreme. You will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. M will brief you as soon as you\\'re ready. Good day, James.\"\\n436,\"This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It should have managed a wider distribution as it\\'s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.<br /><br />The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven\\'t learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you\\'re in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.\"\\n437,\"This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole. This is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman. To support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks. Predictable, but not a bad watch.\"\\n438,\"I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he\\'s only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone\\'s foil. He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. Joining in the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use up most of the picture. Gracie\\'s funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I don\\'t remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively Fields\\', though). The situation is constantly funny: the Whinneys are going to drive to California, but to help them with expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.\"\\n439,\"EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me somewhat of Warren William), heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour.<br /><br />Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast--everyone from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and H.B. Warner. As an added bonus, there\\'s Nat Pendleton as a dimwit detective--and furthermore, get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home. Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.<br /><br />On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled. It\\'s all suddenly clear to detective Philo Vance--and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense.<br /><br />Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.\"\\n440,\"This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot doesn\\'t even make sense. Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she\\'s more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. I\\'m sure the topless girls doesn\\'t hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. I didn\\'t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. I don\\'t recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, I can\\'t think of any part of the movie that was good.\"\\n441,\"Although I was hoping that I\\'d like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I\\'d call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don\\'t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. All things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but I\\'m still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie.\"\\n442,\"Imagine this: a high school. Except it\\'s boarding school, and the kids don\\'t have parents around. Oh, and it\\'s in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the \"\"weird\"\" outcast. And there aren\\'t any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.<br /><br />Here\\'s the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a formerly all-boys school. Absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She\\'s the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her likable.<br /><br />Are we supposed to believe that if we don\\'t even come close to Zoey\\'s perfection, we\\'re bad people? In the show, nothing\\'s her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they\\'re portrayed as the bad guy(Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.<br /><br />Her loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, Michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and Logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.<br /><br />What ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they\\'re normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can\\'t afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. Wow, they have it hard! Any other problems? I\\'m too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what\\'s the 101 for, anyway?) is Nick\\'s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. Except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn\\'t like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on The Hills.<br /><br />But hey, at least the set\\'s pretty.\"\\n443,\"I had been amazed by director Antal\\'s Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /><br />It\\'s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn\\'t really deliver in that department either. <br /><br />What you are left with is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography, cast and the tight music score, you\\'re left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. <br /><br />This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.\"\\n444,\"First of all, the reason I\\'m giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster\\'s comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave \"\"the performance of his career.\"\" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.\"\\n445,\"This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining <br /><br />The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)<br /><br />If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning\"\\n446,\"Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can\\'t. His dialogue sucks too. Anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. You could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. At least the zombies look cool. So anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people.\"\\n447,\"i am finally seeing the El Padrino movie, from what I can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action Damian Chapa is good director, But I must admit I love his acting the Best.<br /><br />Also I saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit.<br /><br />However the film El Padrino is a pure 10 action epic. Why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? I am so happy to see someone I know to be a real great actor become a great director also.<br /><br />I am one of those people who love to see artists make it.<br /><br />B.S.\"\\n448,I thrive on cinema....but there is a limit. A NAME isn\\'t enough to make A MOVIE!. The beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet. But we remain hungry ( or angry..) till the end . Things are getting so confused that I admit that I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE END or was there an end to this nonesense. The opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed. Next...\\n449,\"Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect \"\"catch\"\" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He\\'s a \"\"hero\"\" whom it\\'s very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. However, it\\'s troubles don\\'t end there. It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can\\'t reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). Let\\'s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows. (*1/2)\"\\n450,\"I was drawn to \"\"Friends\"\" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called \"\"Seasons\"\", then I found the Elton John song \"\"Friends\"\" thinking it was the same song...it\\'s been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of \"\"Friends\"\" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. I have more recall of the way the movie hit me than I do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary-eyed at the end as I was. I\\'m both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. \"\"The Graduate\"\" \"\"Easy Rider\"\") now just seem silly and I don\\'t want this to fall into the same category. But, I will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least I\\'ll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. When we met, we went through this with \"\"Last Tango in Paris\"\". The youngsters I work with (I\\'m 56) respect my opinions but it\\'s hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little \"\"aged\"\" now. I just can\\'t figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. \"\"Friends\"\" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It will bring back a lot of special feelings I\\'m sure. By all means, rent or buy a copy... Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today.\"\\n451,\"During the Clete Roberts preface, I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood\\'s Poverty Row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. There are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of \"\"The Well\"\"(1951). The Black and White texture gives a newsreel-like quality. For certain, younger viewers will be reminded of \"\"The Blair Witch Project\"\" but this one IS based on REAL events!\"\\n452,\"I decided to watch this one because it\\'s been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in \"\"shaky hands\"\" camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:<br /><br />American \"\"military machine\"\" (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic.<br /><br />why these \"\"heroic\"\" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of \"\"loving-war-like-a-drug\"\"?.. Oh, please, come on! what a bore! <br /><br />watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall...\"\\n453,\"Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called Mom or with the word Mom in the title.<br /><br />This is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there.<br /><br />It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation.<br /><br />The kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger, who just happens to be a flesh eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie, or ghoul, quite which exactly is not defined.<br /><br />There is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified, attempts to help her by supplying \\'food\\'. (I shall say no more about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It is one of those \\'quiet\\' movies as opposed to guns blasting, explosions raging, car chases, etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish, but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans, whilst also inserting sadness into the story, along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called \\'horror\\' movies.<br /><br />There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so \\'innocent\\', but, what she becomes!! Oh my! <br /><br />A gem of a movie and even if not your thing, should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan.\"\\n454,\"Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you\\'re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It\\'s like a riff on James M. Cain\\'s The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he\\'s not around, and she\\'s at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra. They\\'re soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her (let\\'s just say a \"\"shave\"\"), he knows that he\\'ll find out, and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well. Naturally, this will come back to haunt them - but that it\\'s literally, at least to them (at first super-terrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji), changes gears into the \\'Kaidan\\', a Japanese ghost story.<br /><br />This is a film where the horror comes not simply out of \"\"oh, ghost, ah\"\", but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. In a way there\\'s the mechanics of a film-noir at work throughout, if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century Japanese village as opposed to an American city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop, the \"\"evidence\"\" found possibly by another, word getting around, suspicions aroused, etc). It\\'s compelling because Seiko actually was against the plan from the start, manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to Gisaburo\\'s re-appearances are staggering to her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburo\\'s ghost, pale-blue face and mostly silent, chilling stare, motions for Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She does, reluctantly, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn\\'t know, in the wee hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.<br /><br />While it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end, there\\'s so much here that director Oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses (which, ironically, got banned in his own country), he made something that, he claimed, was even *more* daring that \\'Senses\\'. Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji, a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range), but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would-be lovebirds will go. The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake.<br /><br />And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly, it wouldn\\'t surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot, with repetition working its way into the mis-en-scene (i.e. the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road, the camera at a dutch angle, the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after I finish typing this (i.e. Toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion, or how Seiko\\'s nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). It\\'s daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual, though there may be something with that as well- about life and death\\'s connections to one another, inextricably. It\\'s a classic waiting to be discovered.\"\\n455,\"I am not a big music video fan. I think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song.. Any song. In other words , creative thinking goes out the window. Likewise, Personal feelings aside about MJ, toss aside. This was the best music video of alltime. Simply wonderful. It was a movie. Yes folks it was. Brilliant! You had awesome acting, awesome choreography, and awesome singing. This was spectacular. Simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man , but was he a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing adding to the song and video. MJ was MJ , enough said about that. This song was to video , what Jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECTO. What was even better about this was ,that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts. Though ironically enough, there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. Folks go to Youtube. Take 14 mins. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.\"\\n456,\"Oh, my goodness. I would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon, but here it is. Armed with rotten plot, terrible editing, stilted acting, and headache-inducing \\'style\\' (sorry, I have no other words for it), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better.<br /><br />Now, not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Se7en -- I was under the impression that something didn\\'t smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny, wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors, I knew where that smell was coming from.<br /><br />It turns out that two policemen, or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as \"\"Monkey Killer\"\" (what a menacing, chilling nickname, uh?) for his working methods, has killed quite a lot of people. You see, this nut apparently works following the proverb \"\"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\"\" and cuts eyes, ears, and tongues out of his victims. So far, six eyes, six ears, and three tongues. In very ingenious fashion, Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, good-looking businessman, with a dreadful temper. And that\\'s where the rip-off of American Psycho kicks in.<br /><br />So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting in the least, until they finally meet. Along the way to that, a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes in the back of the disco club, because... well, just because the script tells us it\\'s a suspect place; then, with one single punch in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path, and the guard is never heard of again? Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic?<br /><br />Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick turns in as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct fashion, Smith gets some dates with the young businessman, under the assumption that she might discover his true identity.<br /><br />I won\\'t spoil the ending but it is, quite simply, an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that never get resolved, and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder, supposed to be shocking and sad, comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly can\\'t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it.<br /><br />At 87 minutes, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about one single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never pulled into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin, and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno, and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity.<br /><br />3/10\"\\n457,\"The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three this one is the best.<br /><br />Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn\\'t get enough money to pay for the location. It\\'s the only flaw I find in the film.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss Robert Strauss when the game was raided. He took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.<br /><br />First Bob Strauss who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra\\'s services back. Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who\\'s working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn\\'t won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that Marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak\\'s apartment will leave you shaken.<br /><br />Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She\\'s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. <br /><br />Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.<br /><br />Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the characters live in. Not a place you\\'d want to bring up your family.\"\\n458,\"This film was basically set up for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.<br /><br />I maintain the only way for these two books -Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the 1700\\'s to the 1980\\'s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.<br /><br />Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with Akasha\\'s plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY same names different story.<br /><br />If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But don\\'t piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rice\\'s great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.<br /><br />If you haven\\'t read the books you won\\'t understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, will hate it.\"\\n459,\"Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a \"\"worst case scenario\"\" of playing \"\"strong\"\" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don\\'t waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...<br /><br />I give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, its all the good things this movie isn\\'t.\"\\n460,\"An intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. After she tries to get away from the murder scene, she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat.\"\\n461,\"Don\\'t listen to most of these people. ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love! Its about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who babysits at the Mendrakis\\' house and someone breaks in. if you\\'re wondering how he got in the house, he went through the garage most likely. so anyway, don\\'t listen to, \"\"the worst acting\"\". it has amazing acting. with a great story. I think that there are 2 benefits that Jill has. 1. shes a fast runner and is on the track team. 2.she got out alive! lol.<br /><br />it is a cool movie and quite scary. check it out, you will be happy with this masterpiece. don\\'t listen to the other people on the site. its very good. trust me, i am good at reviewing movies. I\\'m a future movie critic. i totally want to buy this movie. and you will too when you see it. it is amazingly awesome.\"\\n462,\"What a frustrating movie. A small Southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by Carson McCullers already knows. This does none of that. Instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a made-for-TV movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it\\'s hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this--well, there\\'s no other word for it--drivel. A tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great Stockard Channing.\"\\n463,\"This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s, Jack Pearl (radio\\'s \"\"Baron Munchausen\"\") as well as Jimmy Durante. However, 7-1/2 decades later, it\\'s being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.<br /><br />As for the Stooges, this is a film from there very early days--before MGM had any idea what to do with the team. At this point, they were known as \"\"Ted Healy and his Stooges\"\" as Healy was the front man. Fortunately for the Stooges, they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man (read up on him--you\\'ll see what I mean) and the rest is history. Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others). In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And, oddly, in this film they didn\\'t act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle. When they are rescued and brought home, all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show--punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there. As for Pearl, I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films, as he has the personality of a slug (but slightly less welcome). As for Durante, I never knew what the public saw in him--as least as far as his films are concerned--he was loud and...loud! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton\\'s career to make this film. Together, Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor(?) and Vaudeville-style routines that tend to fall rather flat.<br /><br />In this film, the Stooges they didn\\'t yet have the right chemistry. Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd. What they did in the film was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines. Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this, though die-hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life-long goal of seeing everything Stooge--even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films (oh, and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly).<br /><br />Overall, the film is rather dull and disappointing. However, there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess. At about the 13 minute mark, you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing. Look carefully, as this is Walter Brennan in a role you\\'d certainly never expect! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the \"\"Clean as a Whistle\"\" song starting at about 22 minutes into the film. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called \"\"Pre-Code\"\" scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 (when the Production Code was strengthened). Despite the word \"\"Clean\"\" in the title, it\\'s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh--enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything! It\\'s quite shocking when seen today, though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s. Finally, at the 63 minute mark, see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades. See the film, you\\'ll see that I mean!\"\\n464,\"When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking into her brother\\'s death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than \"\"natural causes\"\". The closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They\\'ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.<br /><br />If you\\'re into sleazy, Satanic-themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can\\'t save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total bore. Other than the one scene I\\'ve already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren\\'t shocking and certainly aren\\'t sexy. The acting is spotty at best. Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot really doesn\\'t matter. Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. I\\'m only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, Black Candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.\"\\n465,\"One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a \"\"cold case\"\"-style thriller. It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills.<br /><br />Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. This attitude is very old-style and provincial. It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem.\"\\n466,\"I\\'ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc. so let\\'s focus on the movie and the message.<br /><br />I have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult male.... 2 out of 10.<br /><br />I like pop/rock music, i\\'m 45. I know of Britney Spears but never realised she actually sang Stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. I didn\\'t recognise her poster on the wall so I was not worried about any \\'self promotion\\'.<br /><br />I watch movies to be entertained. i don\\'t care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and does it entertain me.<br /><br />I watched this movie for the message. The world\\'s greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. The movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. I found the Texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don\\'t give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. Great message though...should be more of them.<br /><br />This movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get Hannibal.\"\\n467,\"I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll\\'s home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.d\\'s(again, perhaps). It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before. It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.\"\\n468,\"I had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. It was dumbed down to such an extent, I doubt if I learned a single thing. The graphics were rudimentary. Any small idea was repeated ad nauseum. Contrast this to the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan. That had a good musical theme. There was NO music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional Strings.\"\\n469,\"Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Caine hams it up...which is exactly what the character he is playing should do. Entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching.\"\\n470,\"This movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. It should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri\\'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an \"\"African\"\" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond \"\"fro\"\"? It\\'s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It\\'s just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.\"\\n471,\"When I was a younger(oh about 2)I watched Barney for the first time, and liked it. BUT, back then I didn\\'t exactly have a brain, either. And now I look back and see what a horrible show \"\"Barney\"\" really is: First of all, EVERYTHING on that show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about \"\"imagination....\"\"(*shudders*) B.J.(I know what your thinking about his name.)Is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be \"\"supposudly\"\" cool. But in fact, he is the exact opposite. After watching a few episodes with B.J. dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap, and making a few no-so-funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of a character EVER. She is a green triceratops(it\\'s a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. Her remarks of \"\"hee-hee-hee\"\" and Barney\\'s praises cries of \\'super-deeee-doooper\"\", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the Seventh graders learn about shapes and manners.<br /><br />And that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible.\"\\n472,\"Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. He certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can\\'t save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St. Louis.<br /><br />McQueen\\'s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. There\\'s more than a broad hint that there\\'s a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke. He\\'s not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. <br /><br />Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all pretty rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.<br /><br />The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn\\'t do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided Steve\\'s performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. <br /><br />This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I\\'m willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can\\'t believe they would have if they saw this.<br /><br />Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey.\"\\n473,\"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of \"\"Pre-Code\"\" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren\\'t married and even if their partner IS!! <br /><br />The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want him back, as she realizes he\\'s not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).<br /><br />Surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women\\'s prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.<br /><br />But then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women\\'s prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. Now throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). But now, single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with his assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT, while she\\'s pregnant with his love child, he\\'s indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her he\\'s innocent, but he\\'s convicted and it sure sounds like he\\'s a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends.<br /><br />So, we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunne\\'s character and it\\'s really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. A strong women\\'s rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! With a decent re-write, this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it couldn\\'t make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull Pre-Code film.\"\\n474,\"I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go. Two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.\"\\n475,\"(Very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) <br /><br />IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go...was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles, but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D, not much more then that.<br /><br />The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a look at Jack Black\\'s humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled \"\"Pick of Destiny.\"\" Again, the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times it felt a bit long; it\\'s only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine, except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss, they miss bad. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.<br /><br />I will say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing; The D\\'s humor simply couldn\\'t work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But unless you\\'re a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. \"\"Pick\"\" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? I don\\'t think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just be sure it\\'s your style.\"\\n476,\"I shall begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching. The movie relies on the audience\\'s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it does so very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise it\\'ll be that much better.<br /><br />With that in mind, this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game, on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in each scene, especially in the heavy action oriented ones, is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe.<br /><br />I believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background, the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation).<br /><br />Once again, I myself having only played through FF7 once, thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feel in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this film will blow you out of the water. If you\\'re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film. Characters move with fluidity. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot, I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.<br /><br />Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves.<br /><br />Thanks Square Enix. The wait was well worth it.\"\\n477,\"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. The alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant \"\"galaxy\"\" but didn\\'t bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. A better title for the film would be \"\"It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances.\"\" The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. The humans are all given magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. Any thought to the passage of time is ignored. Now it\\'s a couple days after meeting the alien, then BAM! all of a sudden there\\'s only a couple hours left until zero hour. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will make yourself stupider for having watched it. The ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going \"\"Ta-Da!!!!\"\" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you\\'ll get cancer watching it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself (\"\"enemies of freedom\"\"--honestly) laughing, you\\'re retarded.\"\\n478,\"If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. I guess they just couldn\\'t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly.<br /><br />The title of the movie \"\"Phase IV\"\" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but \"\"Phase I\"\" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don\\'t reach \"\"Phase IV\"\" until the end credits roll. Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: \"\"Hang in there buddy! Only 1 more phase until final credits!\"\" As a MST3K episode, this one wasn\\'t very good for two reasons: 1) This one is from the Season 0 on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad not even J&TB can lighten it up. There are one or two Gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 Gamera movies.<br /><br />The movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but I was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me.\"\\n479,\"Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors, who have a four-day shore leave in Hollywood.Joe knows everything about girls and can\\'t wait to see Lola, while Clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls.They then run into a little boy, Donald Martin, who has ran away in order to join the navy.They take him home and meet his beautiful aunt Susan, who wants to be a singer.Clarence wants Susie to be his girl, but his shyness gets in the way.But he doesn\\'t feel shy with a waitress, who comes from Brooklyn, like he does.Soon Joe notices he\\'s in love with Susie.The boys are in a fix when they lie to Susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don\\'t even know.As they are in a fix with their feelings.George Sidney\\'s Anchors Aweigh (1945) is a great musical comedy.Gene Kelly is top-notch, once again, in his singing and dancing routines.Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn.Shy isn\\'t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra, but he plays his part well.Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott.We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.The 9-year old Dean Stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor.Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself.It\\'s magic what he does with the piano.Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station.Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse.There\\'s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing \"\"We Hate to Leave\"\".It\\'s so energetic.\"\"If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie)\"\" is quite funny.It\\'s a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms\\' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell.It\\'s lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango \"\"Jealousy\"\" .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse.Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused.The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score.Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment.\"\\n480,\"From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson\\'s Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully\\'s Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie \\'The Hyena\\' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn\\'t seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!\"\\n481,\"Things to Come is an early Sci-Fi film that shows an imagined world, or \"\"Everytown\"\" through 100 years. You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the \"\"Boss\"\" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out.<br /><br />This film only has about 3 faults: it\\'s audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren\\'t deep at all, and the overall plot isn\\'t altogether solid. The plot is lacking something that I can\\'t put my finger on... it just seems a little \"\"fluffy.\"\" But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It\\'s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.\"\\n482,\"Weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait...it was only 90 minutes long...it must have just *seemed* a lot longer! I\\'d rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. I\\'m expressing an opinion here: I guess this means I didn\\'t like it.\"\\n483,\"One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.\"\\n484,\"While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. I don\\'t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right.<br /><br />The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on.<br /><br />I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all a excellent movie.\"\\n485,\"this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? i don\\'t know and simply i don\\'t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father\\'s company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film.....\"\\n486,\"I\\'ll not comment a lot, what\\'s to??? Stereotype characters, absolute ignorance about Colombia\\'s reality, awful mise en scene, poor color choice, NOT funny (it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it\\'s beside the nonsense scenes), Very poor actors direction (if you see somewhere those people, I mean the interpreters, you\\'ll know they are at least good, but seeing this so call film, it is impossible to guess it), you get tired of the music... this \"\"comedy\"\" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it\\'s the rap sing in the final credits....pathetic, doesn\\'t it? etc...etc... It has been a long time I haven\\'t seen a movie so bad!!\"\\n487,\"This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I\\'ve seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that it\\'s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. I\\'d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don\\'t get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in.<br /><br />As far as the actual film goes, it could have used a better edit, it\\'s choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It\\'s not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also, thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. She\\'s not a \"\"10\"\" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite.<br /><br />If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you, the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones.<br /><br />Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies don\\'t get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don\\'t put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!!\"\\n488,\"A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth. (Things must be pretty bad back on Mars.) Two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash. Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy\\'s Pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.<br /><br />The diner has had no customers since eleven o\\'clock that morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he didn\\'t notice who they were. The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed. One of them is an alien, but which one? All of them are suspect. There\\'s the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. There\\'s a blustering businessman who must get to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Execrable performance by the husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. And even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride to newly minted husband: \"\"I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin.\"\" The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.<br /><br />It\\'s a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle. There is no discernible \"\"depth\"\" to it. It\\'s not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. It\\'s not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.<br /><br />I always enjoy it when it\\'s on. It\\'s especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM\\'s version of Shakespeare\\'s play. And here he is -- with three arms.<br /><br />Oops.\"\\n489,\"It\\'s rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber\\'s parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter.\"\\n490,\"Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn\\'t quite get the director\\'s intentions if any. I wonder if she\\'s ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you\\'ll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it\\'s just me.\"\\n491,\"This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space. As a history of space flight, it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it. Disney has shown it on \"\"Vault Disney\"\" and I wish they would do so again.\"\\n492,\"In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious \\'space-dust\\') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family\\'s recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal\\'s collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido\\'s trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole \\'reanimated dead\\' theme that I have seen.<br /><br />Connelly\\'s Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead\\'s Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead\\'s Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin\\'s performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K\\'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentions\\x97Ray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!<br /><br />This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.\"\\n493,\"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted \"\"Rodeo\"\" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the \"\"ups and downs\"\" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style. He and Mr. Coburn teamed up extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also, check out Anne Archer as Coburn\\'s Native American love interest in the latter part of the movie. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /><br />Not as flashy, perhaps, as \"\"Junior Bonner\"\", but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel for showing this true grit of an under-rated movie from time to time.\"\\n494,\"Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as \\'Mills and Boon\\', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.\"\\n495,\"\"\"American Nightmare\"\" is officially tied, in my opinion, with \"\"It\\'s Pat!\"\" for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Seven friends (oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of \"\"Friends\"\") gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It\\'s hosted by a guy with a beard. That\\'s the most exciting aspect of his show.<br /><br />Chandler, Monica, Joey, and... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening...<br /><br />Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. These fears include such stunners as \"\"voodoo\"\" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.<br /><br />No. Really.<br /><br />This movie was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse\\'s killing spree lacks motivation, there\\'s nothing to make the viewer \"\"jump,\"\" the ending blows, and--again--voodoo?<br /><br />If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent \"\"American Nightmare\"\" with them.<br /><br />If you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local Blockbuster, rent all of the copies of \"\"American Nightmare\"\" and hide them in your freezer.\"\\n496,\"First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot, and doesn\\'t explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of \"\"melting\"\" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I don\\'t think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.\"\\n497,\"This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner\\'s name on the cover. It\\'s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil\\' Pimp must lay down for his homies.<br /><br />The animation isn\\'t very good in this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I\\'m sure it was. It doesn\\'t suck, it\\'s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn\\'t think any of it was funny.\"\\n498,\"I was disgusted by this movie. No it wasn\\'t because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows one piece of art work that she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial.<br /><br />I don\\'t know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia (aka had sex with) while she states over and over again \"\"It\\'s true\"\".<br /><br />I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about. Don\\'t base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work.<br /><br />Don\\'t see the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.\"\\n499,\"Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar\\'s A Bug\\'s Life; we\\'re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer \\x96 when it\\'s in the right hands that is \\x96 A Bug\\'s Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.<br /><br />It is only Pixar\\'s second animated feature. The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />After all, it\\'s a film about ants. Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug\\'s Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you\\'ll probably ever encounter.<br /><br />Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable \\x96 there isn\\'t an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters \\x96 but they\\'re colourful, they\\'re eclectic, and they\\'re idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug\\'s Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the \\'black sheep\\' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season\\'s harvest with his antics.<br /><br />The problem arises in the fact that the ants\\' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack\\'s hands; however, it\\'s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Flik\\'s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony\\'s rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.<br /><br />If you think about it, A Bug\\'s Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line\\'s of Akira Kurosawa\\'s classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies \\x96 one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bug\\'s Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.<br /><br />Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who\\'s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It\\'s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.<br /><br />As I\\'ve said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bug\\'s Life even better is that the film isn\\'t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film \\x96 the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we\\'d like. However, it\\'s easy to ignore this fault, and it\\'s incredulously easy to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Although A Bug\\'s Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that they\\'re not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it\\'s only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bug\\'s Life other than: see it; it\\'s not quite the best which we\\'ve seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year \\x96 and I\\'ll be damned if this isn\\'t the best animated feature of 1998.<br /><br />8.5/10\"\\n500,What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel. I do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy has got to be the worst casting decision EVER...anyway back to this version. It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. It succeeds in both but high art it is nit. Throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe...The direction was average and the editing abysmal. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasted talents. The part of Heath was played with great charm and belief and I think that the casting is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. Its clear that he was a director for hire and didn\\'t instill the project with the passion that it deserved.\\n501,\"My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger. It\\'s about Andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But of course, Nicole isn\\'t that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i\\'m guessing. She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10\"\\n502,\"It is surprising that a production like this gets made these days, especially for television. Considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given superb treatment and direction.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable. There is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. Also, this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on TV and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with this. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means!<br /><br />The BBC have made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.\"\\n503,\"I just don\\'t get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there\\'s anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe it\\'s the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also don\\'t quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesn\\'t the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? There\\'s one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its lamest, I\\'ll always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldn\\'t purchase it except for a used copy under $3.\"\\n504,\"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she\\'s a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can\\'t fault any of the protagonist\\'s acting, or anyone else\\'s in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn\\'t make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess\\' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They\\'re funny, they\\'re refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~\"\\n505,\"I know that you\\'ve already entered this in film festivals (or at least I think you have, I may just be making that up) but I think this should get \"\"best animated short film\"\" in every one. Bravo. I can\\'t wait for the full film. I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I\\'m just trying to get ten lines of text... Though I still mean it. And here comes yet another -SHOE!- and I cannot stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I\\'ll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic \"\"Jason Steele Marathon.\"\" I do have a lot of those.<br /><br />-R\"\\n506,\"This is probably the first entry in the \"\"Lance O\\'Leary/Nurse Keat\"\" detective series; in subsequent O\\'Leary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee.<br /><br />A group of relatives (all played by well-known character actors) gathers in an old house (on a rainy nite, of course!) to speak to a wealthy relative, who goes into a coma.<br /><br />While they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen, including a couple of murders.<br /><br />A creepy film; worth seeing!\"\\n507,\"This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. It was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. Why don\\'t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? It\\'s quite effective.<br /><br />Fire and Ice, in it\\'s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it\\'s esthetic quality. I for sure did not mind! Bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I don\\'t think he has to apoligize since it\\'s pretty much animation for adults. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it.<br /><br />This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it\\'s possibly Bakshi\\'s finest. For those who like animations with lushious women: try Space Adventure Cobra as well.<br /><br />I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.\"\\n508,\"My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10<br /><br />This show sucks very much officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I don\\'t know, in the other CSIs you get into the episode you\\'re watching. But in this one, you just can\\'t get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. I know people have different opinions, and I respect that, but for me, this CSI ain\\'t good enough. So if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, I suggest you to watch CSI Miami.\"\\n509,\"I am not a Faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since I grew up near the author\\'s hometown); however, I think this is an excellent movie. On par with the quality of the movie \"\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\"\". If you haven\\'t seen it, buy it anyway. It\\'s well worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently played the movie as a part of the Race on Film series. I wish they\\'d play it more often. Very moving.<br /><br />On a side note, the folks from Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940\\'s. The Courthouse, City Hall, etc.: They\\'re all on screen. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in the front of City Hall, I began to get suspicious. Look closely at the pennants on Chick\\'s wall: You\\'ll see two for Ole Miss !\"\\n510,\"Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film delivers the spell-casting special effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely silly caricatures. You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting camp.<br /><br />It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula. They won\\'t be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.\"\\n511,\"I can\\'t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it\\'s his company. But \"\"you\\'re fired\"\" or \"\"you\\'re hired\"\", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn\\'t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I\\'d love to hear just one person get up and say \"\"Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo\"\". I see he\\'s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don\\'t have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I\\'d give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn\\'t deserve that.\"\\n512,\"If I had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It\\'s just boring, pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />The last French movie I saw was \"\"Romance\"\" and it too was pretty dismal, but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- it\\'ll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (It\\'s called Dogme 95 because that\\'s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.)<br /><br />\"\\n513,\"The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri\\'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can\\'t say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He\\'s one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I\\'m currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I\\'m glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too\"\"real\"\" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis\\'s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don\\'t want to give anything away) Sorry, but it\\'s just not my type of show.\"\\n514,\"First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can\\'t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. <br /><br />I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the \"\"plot twist\"\" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Lois\\'s 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of Superman. When the crying super-child throws a piano at Lex\\'s henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. It\\'s been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. <br /><br />My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn\\'t take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what\\'s wrong with that. I don\\'t know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That\\'s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. <br /><br />My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a God-like Jor-el sent to Earth to be a savior. Jor-el wasn\\'t all-wise, he was just a scientist. And he didn\\'t send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I\\'ll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ\\'s primary weakness. Furthermore, the \"\"crucifixion\"\" scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite \"\"spear\"\" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I\\'m too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie \"\"Superman Returns: the Passion of the Christ.\"\"<br /><br />And speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint has to do with Singer\\'s depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns, as well as all the previous Superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous Superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singer\\'s next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!<br /><br />To summarize, I don\\'t know what I hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don\\'t hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven\\'t already. Don\\'t see it, don\\'t buy it when it comes out on DVD, don\\'t rent it...basically don\\'t contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact, I think that for every person that sees this movie, Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you\\'re a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you\\'ll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.\"\\n515,\"This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I have heard the Merman cast album, the Angela Lansbury album, I have seen Tyne Daly live, and I\\'ve seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is if not the best, then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always-dependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top. There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Auntie Mame.\"\\n516,\"I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn.<br /><br />The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. Maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. At the very least, the pacing should have been picked up.<br /><br />While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were just pointless.<br /><br />It was a complete waste of my time.\"\\n517,\"Is it a perfect movie? No. It is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the British army efficiency.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie I was rather young and all I can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and Mathilda May. Actually, if it weren\\'t for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, I probably wouldn\\'t have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, I am now actually considering voting it up!<br /><br />Lucky for me I got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. I still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?\"\\n518,\"Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The O.C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle.<br /><br />BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films/television shows, which deal with the subjects I referenced, I think you will find at least something here.<br /><br />In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way, I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon\\'s belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.<br /><br />The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays \\'Lacy Rand\\'. While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something I think needs work. I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident.<br /><br />Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where \\'Caprica\\' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did.\"\\n519,\"I\\'m the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from the b grade to the Hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn\\'t to good, compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz (quite good) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both Ice-T and the other dude, this kills the Jamaican, however Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to Ice\\'s other movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) were Snoops character is supernatural, however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird, Benny isn\\'t introduced in this movie and the scene isn\\'t in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn\\'t mention what happen 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word wide-was a good part of the film, even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was OK tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don\\'t love em like i do Don\\'t WATCH IT. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars, and my love of the genre.<br /><br />Nathaniel Purez\"\\n520,\"I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...<br /><br />Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).<br /><br />The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES, to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals.<br /><br />The Movie plays out very, very differently: 1: There\\'s a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of \"\"backstory\"\" before we even get to the \\'boat blowing up\\' scene. 2: Jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... Nothing like the game... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end... 4: The \\'Modified Soldiers\\' look like albinos with singlets on... And there was no mutated \\'monkey-like\\' creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: There is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, LITTLE reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: There\\'s an Ending scene... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after... WHAT THE!<br /><br />I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer, you will HATE this movie will all your soul. It is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... So if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played Farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...\"\\n521,\"one of the best ensemble acted films I\\'ve ever seen. There isn\\'t much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. You see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. Truly \"\"enchanted\"\".\"\\n522,\"I haven\\'t seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /><br />When asked about my favorite films, this is the one that I seem to always mention first. There are certain films (works of art like this film, \"\"Dark City\"\", and \"\"Breaking the Waves\"\") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend... This film \"\"shook\"\" me when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.\"\\n523,\"Today, I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood.<br /><br />Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.<br /><br />However, I can\\'t not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry I am at the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they? <br /><br />To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you have a soul.<br /><br />Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all.\"\\n524,\"You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed. That\\'s why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea.<br /><br />And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can\\'t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame), however, they don\\'t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.<br /><br />So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT. Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification, that even I\\'m impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they\\'re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,<br /><br />There\\'s no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect), steering wheels, gear shifts (always shifting up and not down), all these while having the actors make pretend that they\\'re the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that\\'s why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.<br /><br />The heroine (yes, it made a statement that girls can drive) Natasha (a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don\\'t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides). Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous (Eddie Griffin), she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.<br /><br />And it\\'s almost always the same, as there\\'s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created - Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it\\'s one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.<br /><br />If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action. Strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines.\"\\n525,\"Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I\\'m picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.\"\\n526,\"Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. That shot of McQueen\\'s Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman\\'s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman\\'s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then of course, San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. Also, Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still \"\"Hot\"\" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Seven ups had a few \"\"jumps\"\" over little hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.\"\\n527,\"Have you ever heard the saying that people \"\"telegraph their intentions?\"\" Well in this movie, the characters\\' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz\\'s character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh doesn\\'t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque \"\"Southern\"\" accents employed by British actors.\"\\n528,\"\"\"Night of the Living Homeless\"\" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.<br /><br />Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming \"\"I don\\'t have any change!!\"\" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.<br /><br />The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man\\'s house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in \"\"Fantastic Easter Special\"\" two weeks ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man\\'s head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger.<br /><br />In Evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California.<br /><br />The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10\"\\n529,\"<br /><br />I\\'m not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the ending though.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />Tell me why on Earth does she run over to her uncle\\'s(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what\\'s going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. Instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying \"\"I know everything, I have proof! You didn\\'t expect proof, did you?!\"\" Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he\\'s going to harm her. Well DUH! Of course he\\'s going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. What a dumb ending.\"\\n530,I gave this a 1. There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. Total mayhem. Everyone gets killed or nearly so. I am tired of cross hairs and changing views. I cannot give the plot away. Convoluted and insane. If I had paid to see this I would demand my money back. I wish reviews were more honest.\\n531,Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sage\\'s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline. This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you\\'ve seen something special.(7/10)\\n532,\"I read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing. Robbins is a talented filmaker and I wish he would add more to his repetoire. He made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. An especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.\"\\n533,\"DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. The imagery and cinematography are superb, and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, for his chilling portrayal.\"\\n534,\"I just got this video used and I was watching it last night. The acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. The story was very well written, and it\\'s refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old \"\"disaster formulas\"\" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.<br /><br />While this movie had a very weird mix of FX and acting quality, this merits an A in my book.\"\\n535,\"This film is really vile. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context. I\\'m not saying that urban crime wasn\\'t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren\\'t/aren\\'t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it\\'s not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol. And of course he knows how to play the system. Does that sound familiar. Yes. This turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. It\\'s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this.\"\\n536,\"What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn\\'s talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids weren\\'t even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!\"\\n537,\"Motocrossed was fun, but it wasn\\'t that great. I guess I just didn\\'t understand a lot of the Motocross racing \"\"lingo\"\" (and there was A LOT of that in the film)! The plot wasn\\'t what I expected from the Disney Channel previews, so that could account for some of my disappointment.\"\\n538,\"Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it.<br /><br />A failure as a horror movie because it simply ain\\'t scary at all. Works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (Too many wisecracks, that\\'s for sure.) The actors aren\\'t interesting (save Robert Englund, as always, and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. The finale is OK but doesn\\'t provide as many sparks as I think one might hope.<br /><br />In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer\\'s story, it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before.<br /><br />There are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.<br /><br />Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer.<br /><br />One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits.<br /><br />4/10\"\\n539,\"OK, I\\'m Italian but there aren\\'t so many Italian film like this. I think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. But it\\'s the only little mistake. The Consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. I\\'d like very much the lighting work on it. The best thing on it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. But it\\'s only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it\\'s too slow, it\\'s so boring, so many silences, but i think that this components its fantastic, its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl, the grand-daughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian films.\"\\n540,\"If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, make it this one! This is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. The other \"\"Ernest\"\" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not ME, however.).<br /><br />In this movie, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case. The murderer, Nash, just happens to look EXACTLY like our bumbling hero Ernest. Mr. Nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him, and so we get to see how Ernest reacts in the slammer.<br /><br />A great flick! If you haven\\'t already seen it, watch it!\"\\n541,\"An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. So, no new story lines here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife\\'s teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film. If not, move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)\"\\n542,\"The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn\\'t understand. It was, on the non-literal level, a \"\"man vs. cruel nature\"\" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man\\'s petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10, and it\\'s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.<br /><br />The second movie, Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. There is no \"\"homage\"\" or \"\"tribute\"\" here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).<br /><br />That we see something from \"\"behind the scenes\"\" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. And, in this movie, those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That\\'s just flippin\\' stupid. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay to see this.<br /><br />The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.\"\\n543,\"I have just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. Howsoever, at the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was earnest about this movie. It\\'s a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! What to say for Jason Statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... For this reasons I vote: 3/10\"\\n544,\"I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn\\'t make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it\\'s always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I\\'ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a \\'Lexicon\\' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It\\'s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesn\\'t exist! In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. Talk about ego! Putting soapbox away, God Bless Maegi\"\\n545,\"\"\"I presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry.\"\" - VAL<br /><br />Mike Nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, \"\"Movie Megacheese.\"\" I asked myself, \"\"Why would Mike Nelson steer me wrong?\"\" I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson.<br /><br />The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I\\'m sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol\\' Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don\\'t watch...for the love of God...don\\'t watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...I\\'m doomed now, I understand this. I accept this.

The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@! My god, It NEVER ended!.....I remember thinking I would have rather kissed the movie theater floor, then sit through this one again.<br /><br />But what do you expect? Most people with the brain power to look up reviews, are not going to be the target audience here at all- so GO SEE Pirites 2 again, or the Jet Lee one, -If your debating to yourself. Look, This movie will just cost you your soul, your money, your energy, and your brain cells. HEED THE WARNING.\"\\n547,\"This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot\\'s of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character \"\"Max\"\" a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV, plays the bad guy,, \"\"Livingston\"\". The plot centers around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, Italian Mafia, and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in Boston,, where you have some great shots , and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want. Check out Sutherland\\'s toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me.\"\\n548,\"If you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! But if you are somewhat normal, and don\\'t need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. This movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.With the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.I\\'ve seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (BTK movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.We watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn\\'t sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.If anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. The entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked.\"\\n549,\"Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War. This time we\\'re told about the story of Carol (lovely played by débutant Clara Lago), a little girl which comes to live to a little Spanish village from New York. It is such an initiating trip, and soon she\\'ll find about the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions.<br /><br />Imanol Uribe makes his best film since \"\"Días Contados\"\" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script. He tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and let us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta.<br /><br />A well cared production.<br /><br />My rate: 7/10\"\\n550,\"A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.<br /><br />It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film \"\"Rollercoaster\"\". This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to \"\"Death of Ocean View Park\"\".<br /><br />As to the film itself, the storyline of a \"\"supernatural\"\" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don\\'t believe this film was intended to be another \"\"Citizen Kane\"\"; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; \"\"let\\'s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!\"\".<br /><br />For the casual movie viewer, this would be a \"\"see once and forget about it\"\" film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a \"\"walk down memory lane\"\" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first \"\"Harborfest\"\", and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome.\"\\n551,\"I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan\\'s role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma\\'s direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.\"\\n552,\"A trio of buddies, sergeants all in the British Army, carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save scores of the Queen\\'s soldiers from certain massacre.<br /><br />Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling\\'s classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood\\'s Golden Year of 1939. Filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.<br /><br />It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. However, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.<br /><br />(It\\'s interesting to note, parenthetically, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence, keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.)<br /><br />The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling\\'s poem ring true. He is unforgettable.<br /><br />Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine\\'s father.<br /><br />The film picks its villains well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. Henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares.\"\\n553,\"This movie pretty much sucked. I\\'m in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. If your in the Military and you see this movie you\\'ll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do. It was a pretty gory movie I\\'d have to say the least. There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. I\\'d recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military. I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one.\"\\n554,If you watched Pulp Fiction don\\'t see this movie. This movie is NOT funny. This is the worst parody movie ever. This is a poor attempt of parody films.<br /><br />The cast is bad. The film is bad. This is one of the worst pictures ever made.<br /><br />I do not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody films ever made.<br /><br />Plump Fiction is not a good movie. It is not funny. It is so dumb and vulgar.\\n555,\"I went to see \"\"Passion of Mind\"\" because I usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. \"\"Sliding Doors,\"\" \"\"Me, Myself, I,\"\" etc. <br /><br />But this was the worst one I\\'ve ever seen! I had to force myself to sit through it. I didn\\'t even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.<br /><br />The magical realism was completely missing because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.<br /><br />There was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of The Elektra Complex; maybe the magic shouldn\\'t be explained for this genre to work.<br /><br />(originally written 5/28/2000)\"\\n556,\"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don\\'t get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas\\' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett\\'s name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can\\'t stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda\\'s death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wan\\'s death okay but Yoda\\'s not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add, it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don\\'t believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando\\'s base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.<br /><br />The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father\\'s face because it made it complete. By Annakin\\'s revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that\\'s is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke\\'s father...Isn\\'t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?<br /><br />On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that \"\"Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let\\'s see.\"\" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.<br /><br />I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!<br /><br />Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as \"\"just another sequel\"\") to trash the movie such as \"\"This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!\"\" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.<br /><br />\"\\n557,\"Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned Gentleman\\'s Agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying \"\"It\\'s because I\\'m Jewish, isn\\'t it?\"\" It\\'s much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the Warners\\' DVD doesn\\'t mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic one, but it\\'s interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish, there\\'s little doubt in Sam Levene\\'s performance that the character is in fact also gay \\x96 not a mincing caricature, but there\\'s definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with George Cooper\\'s confused soldier. There\\'s not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.<br /><br />There\\'s an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young\\'s Maigret-like detective, Gloria Grahame\\'s tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan\\'s excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. A big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC, which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews. So much for crusading\\x85\"\\n558,\"This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It\\'s always interesting to see the story from the \\'other\\' side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.<br /><br />It\\'s interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the \\'villains\\'. In this movie those \\'villains\\' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you\\'re fighting against. At first it\\'s kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German\\'s are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.<br /><br />The way this story is told isn\\'t however the best. It\\'s hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isn\\'t always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesn\\'t always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.<br /><br />The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn\\'t even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.<br /><br />The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I don\\'t know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that they\\'re being played by well cast actors. All of the actors aren\\'t the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.<br /><br />All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.<br /><br />7/10\"\\n559,\"So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert\\'s book \"\"I hated, hated, hated this movie\"\" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review \"\"Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor\"\". So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert\\'s review of Rob Reiner\\'s \"\"North\"\" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don\\'t think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this \"\"movie\"\" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss\\'s girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra\\'s \"\"My Way\"\" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that \"\"Independence Day\"\" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that \"\"Independence Day\"\" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if \"\"Independence Day\"\" were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of \"\"Mad Dog Time\"\" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of \"\"Mad Dog Time\"\" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it\\'s honor as the worst movie ever.\"\\n560,\"What a boring film! To sum it all up, its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. Can someone say BORING??? The concept wasn\\'t too bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, overall the cinematography came up short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie was the song \"\"Ishq Kamina\"\", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.\"\\n561,\"{rant start} I didn\\'t want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \"\"Gwoemul\"\" (aka \"\"The Host\"\") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film \"\"Shiri/Swiri\"\", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end}<br /><br />The only \"\"reason\"\" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes. Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \"\"Dragonheart\"\", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember \"\"Dungeons & Dragons\"\" in 2000? Hasn\\'t anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use, but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem \"\"Arirang\"\" being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I\\'ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).\"\\n562,\"As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a \\'better world\\'. I said \\'better world\\' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! <br /><br />I guess most western audience may don\\'t know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means \\'the land and the people\\') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.<br /><br />Another fact is, Qin Shihuang\\'s empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.<br /><br />Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.\"\\n563,\"This had a great cast with big-name stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939.<br /><br />Now the bad news.......regrettably, I can\\'t say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light....and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the \"\"good guys\"\" is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. Well, that\\'s the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad.<br /><br />Hey Hollywood: here\\'s a news flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look it up!\"\\n564,\"I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors, I\\'m sure Robin and his men would have young, after all people didn\\'t live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin\\'s granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it\\'s a shame they couldn\\'t at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.\"\\n565,\"I don\\'t normally write reviews, but this \"\"film\"\" was special. I couldn\\'t turn it off. I don\\'t believe I\\'ve ever seen a worse movie, but there I sat, watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn\\'t turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it\\'s a sports thriller, but it\\'s so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it\\'s not funny, not even in a dumb/silly way. It\\'s like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. It\\'s painful to watch, but at least it\\'s only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. <br /><br />Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. The writing, directing, acting, and everything was just terrible. The problem is I can\\'t describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I\\'m sure this will NEVER be shown again, so unless you saw it, you\\'re out of luck. I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other \"\"bad\"\" film I\\'ve seen over my lifetime. And for every film I see in the future that I can\\'t stand, I will think to myself, well, at least it wasn\\'t bad as the Second String.\"\\n566,\"Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.<br /><br />(No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter\\'s \"\"amazing\"\" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)<br /><br />Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.<br /><br />That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the \"\"star power\"\" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew Aaron) who\\'s review was \"\"of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!,\"\" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I\\'m betting the older charas too) and loving the \"\"cuteness\"\" of the child characters.<br /><br />And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, \"\"Ponyo\"\" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names Soske (somewhat like \"\"The Little Mermaid\"\"), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo\\'s Mother, Soske\\'s mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.<br /><br />But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. <br /><br />Once human, she teams up with her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He\\'s related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you\\'re not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.<br /><br />In the end, Ponyo\\'s father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter\\'s decision and his estranges wife\\'s wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will \"\"remember him fondly.\"\" And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical \"\"bad guy.\"\" Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a \"\"bad person.\"\" All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /><br />And then there\\'s the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. <br /><br />In the end, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki\\'s best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki\\'s Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.\"\\n567,\"Attractive Marjorie(Farrah Fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker.

The whole thing played like a CNN \\'worst case scenario\\'. Even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn\\'t seem sincere.

In 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at Radio City; 44c to 75c first run at Loew\\'s Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. What counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office \"\"media spin.\"\" The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the movie\\'s focus was on the music. Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanza\\'s voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it\\'s almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less. Don\\'t be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.\"\\n572,\"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying \"\"general\"\" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film\\'s most unforgettable emotional moment. The \"\"specific\"\" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and \"\"wowing\"\"...I haven\\'t seen such angry seas since \"\"The Perfect Storm\"\". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO\\'s \"\"Carnivale\"\" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard\\'s Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. The film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.\"\\n573,\"1) I am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffles in WWI and WWII. In movie we can see privates, armed with \"\"M1 Garand\"\" (invented in year 1932!), not authentic \"\"1903 Springfield\"\" (aka \"\"Silent Death\"\"), who privates use until WWII. Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi - automatic, Springfield requires reloading after every shot. Little difference?! 2) German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too. Especially - helmets. German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top, we cannot see even one in movie. And if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this \"\"True Story\"\"? I am surprised, how much \"\"truthful\"\" can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation.\"\\n574,\"Do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made? Stop wondering. I\\'m telling you, Michael is it!<br /><br />It is not \"\"heartwarming,\"\" \"\"entertaining,\"\" or \"\"Travolta at his best.\"\" It just sucks. If I had kids, I would let them watch Deep Throat before Michael!<br /><br />A sold-out John Travolta, a washed-up and balding William Hurt, and an about to die any time now Jean Stapleton highlight this turd of a film.<br /><br />But wait...you\\'ll get to hear Andie McDowell sing! Yeah. Hollywood really s**t all over us with this one!\"\\n575,\"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn\\'t like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can\\'t help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother\\'s film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as \"\"who\\'s on first\"\" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that \"\"who\\'s on first\"\" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6\\'s to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humor?!\"\\n576,\"I was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the show\\'s creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this show doesn\\'t even come close to delivering. All of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All of the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I\\'m being nice). It\\'s the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />If you\\'re Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you\\'re white you\\'d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. It\\'s only a problem when it isn\\'t funny - as in this show.<br /><br />Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how come the producers of this show couldn\\'t find any?\"\\n577,\"First of all \"\"Mexican werewolf in Texas\"\" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of Furlough in Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. And I guess it actually works because that\\'s the reason why I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway the movie isn\\'t any good. Actually it\\'s bloody awful. But I didn\\'t expect anything else when I bought it. It\\'s a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.<br /><br />This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. It\\'s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. It\\'s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. She\\'s the worst of them all. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (And I\\'ve seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies she can\\'t stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her.<br /><br />Some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. The ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. The gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty hilarious really, but that\\'s the way I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it\\'s easy to see that it\\'s a guy in suit.<br /><br />Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it\\'s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. I recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.\"\\n578,\"This movie is so God-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. \"\"You lose, we win, yay!\"\" This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. And if you\\'re even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) I have one thing to ask of you: didn\\'t you even look at the cover? I mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! \"\"Oy vey!\"\" This movie sucked.\"\\n579,\"The symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet the lover buys, and the love triangle at the heart of the story.\"\\n580,\"I found this movie to be very good in all areas. The acting was brilliant from all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell\\'s Character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. The plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece. Go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie(Before it even started).....You won\\'t regret it,if you go see it...\"\\n581,\"Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a \"\"jollies\"\" project for Robert Redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br /><br />The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford\\'s small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team-mates. Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I\\'m not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn\\'t really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br />Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn\\'t need to do much and indeed doesn\\'t, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he\\'s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though, there\\'s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don\\'t fully compensate and you don\\'t care a fig for any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it.\"\\n582,\"I would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but that\\'s probably because I live a short distance from there. Even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it\\'s the theme that\\'s so important here. I\\'m just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on us. Try it...you\\'ll like it!\"\\n583,\"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it\\'s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"\"with it\"\" to be understood by us mortals.\"\\n584,\"I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The movie is diamond among coals during this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. This film should have made them stars. Shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. It could have easily been a franchise. Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You won\\'t be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It\\'ll blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have.\"\\n585,\"A drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small Wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can\\'t escape the title town. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as \"\"Lyle from Dallas,\"\" the real hit man. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. The script by brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and John\\'s direction creates a terrific \"\"neo noir\"\" atmosphere. Witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up.\"\\n586,\"I really liked this movie. I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.\"\\n587,\"Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.<br /><br />The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product\\'s TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. But this is what he says; we actually don\\'t see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real \"\"sahlep\"\" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.<br /><br />In a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. Annoyed by the nagging of his wife, Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. One of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. When he returns home, suddenly we see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile, the thief boys got sick eating too much ice-cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali\\'s bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.<br /><br />Although the plot may look promising in a way, it\\'s the story-telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. First, the director doesn\\'t show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali\\'s troubles are not convincing because we don\\'t see it, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big ice-cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. We don\\'t see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorbike is found, it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism of globalism.<br /><br />Second, the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and \"\"clever\"\" but they are not clever jokes at all, they are just cheesy. Maybe I\\'m wrong, maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars, or to have a political message! If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man\\'s big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying \"\"f**k you,\"\" then you may find this film funny.\"\\n588,\"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie\\'s leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan gets Ollie\\'s clothes, as the Doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. Filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn\\'t great, but it\\'s a black and white film worth looking at. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians\\' Comedian. Okay!\"\\n589,\"OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well documented failings. This however was the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD the effects are vastly superior. However the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone\\'s favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the \"\"characters\"\" consistently verge on the moronic. I feel like trying out Uwe Boll\\'s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. OK there it is. I have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is House of the dead 2.\"\\n590,\"I was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80\\'s. I was born on may 14th 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80\\'s. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80\\'s style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn\\'t see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the Chipmunk\\'s adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. While they are talking, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world (Even though, technically Dave is only going to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as \\'\\'The World\\'\\'). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. Later, at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of \\'\\'Around the World in 30 days\\'\\' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, Alvin get\\'s in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team\\'s likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to \\'\\'varify that they were there\\'\\'. The winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt \\'\\'The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll\\'\\' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It\\'s also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include \\'\\'Getting Lucky\\'\\'(Kind of Suggestive for a kid\\'s film eh?) and \\'\\'My Mother\\'\\' as well as \\'\\'Wooly Bully\\'\\' and \\'\\'Off to see the world\\'\\' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with \\'\\'My mother\\'\\' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song \\'\\'Getting Lucky\\'\\' I first didn\\'t think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince\\'s men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it\\'s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells \\'\\'ALVIN!\\'\\' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven\\'t seen this flick, give it a watch, It\\'s worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80\\'s gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />\\'\\'Headin\\' for the top, Don\\'t you know! we never stop believing now\\'\\'\"\\n591,\"Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a \"\"Bomb\"\" rating, a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night. I feared the worst knowing its reputation, and it was as God-awful as I\\'d anticipated. This is a Mexican-made mess, dubbed into English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It\\'s got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening Santa who doesn\\'t operate at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who doesn\\'t have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus doesn\\'t observe the child labor laws!<br /><br />Eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa\\'s Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it\\'s bound to frighten little children and turn them off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly, the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. This easily makes my personal list of the \"\"Worst Movie I\\'ve Ever Seen\"\", but I\\'m sure that\\'s nothing unique.\"\\n592,\"As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost. Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.<br /><br />There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid. Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.<br /><br />Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn\\'t much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia. In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli\\'s love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.<br /><br />John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia\\'s fiancé.<br /><br />I rated this film an 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing. The photography alone is worth the price of admission.\"\\n593,\"My father grew grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little kid he had episodes on VHS and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and I loved it.<br /><br />Clark Kent and Lois Lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it\\'s up to Superman to stop this mayhem.<br /><br />It\\'s just so wonderful and fun to view. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid, and I\\'m 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.\"\\n594,This unpretentious Horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic. Much much better than 90% of the Scream rip-offs out there! I even hope they come up with a sequel!\\n595,\"I read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but I felt that it truly transported me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. I watched this with someone who didn\\'t read the book and he also enjoyed it. They had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film. It leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over. You feel for the characters and their plights. I highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghani culture. There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.\"\\n596,\"Years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. Deathly boring, I found it hard to sit through as I could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed \\'mystery\\'. Is Sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. No one at all. Skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks.<br /><br />My Grade: D-\"\\n597,\"In short if you want to watch Burt Reynolds best films than this one must be included. If you don\\'t like Burt you may still like this. If you love Burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta it does hit home but it\\'s also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami, or LA. The film is funny at points with & good plot & good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real & the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)A nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it has some good old fashion shootouts & fistfights (no CGI thank God REAL ACTION!)<br /><br />If Clint Eastwood did his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with \"\"Every Which Way But Loose\"\" & \"\"Any Which Way You Can\"\" then Burt responded with his best Clint type flick with this, & it comes off great!\"\\n598,\"I have watched Love Jones over thirty times. It is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be African-Americans. The dialogue was realistically written, and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional African-Americans. This is virtually an untapped market. Love Jones was visually captivating as well. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love. The feeling of the film is jazz and blues, and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you hadn\\'t guessed, I loved it!\"\\n599,\"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It\\'s really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn\\'t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can\\'t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There\\'s also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn\\'t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby\\'s ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I\\'m disappointed; not that it\\'s bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10\"\\n600,\"This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched. At the age of 12 I was up late and ran across the movie. It was on the USA channel, Gilbert Godfrey\\'s Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and weird age. It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. This movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. I now have a daughter that is 12. Have been searching for a couple years for this movie. If it ever does come out on DVD I would be the first to buy. Would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.\"\\n601,\"Holes is an awesome movie. I love it a lot and it\\'s one of my favorite films. It\\'s one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isn\\'t cheesy. Holes is generally a very cool motion picture. I wish Disney would make more pictures like it. Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool. Don\\'t get the wrong idea, I don\\'t mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it\\'s stuff is aimed towards kids and THAT\\'S OKAY. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. But not with Holes. It\\'s the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it\\'s corny. Really, it\\'s the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to.<br /><br />Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this.\"\\n602,\"I cannot hate on the show. When the old (and better) tech TV had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. \"\"Attack of the Show\"\" is the replacement for the Screen Savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn\\'t pan out for some reason.<br /><br />Eventually (I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, this is what I read) the two got married. That was a big secret to me! Now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She\\'s hiding something in those tops she wears, while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasn\\'t afraid to show it.<br /><br />AHEM! Sorry.<br /><br />\"\"Attack of the Show\"\" deals with everything young people want to know about. It\\'s music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. This is what\\'s great about the show. If you don\\'t want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV, you can get all you want on AOTS. Some segments and bits they do are funny. They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names.<br /><br />Even though the hosts aren\\'t as geek as I\\'d like them to be, I still have found \"\"Attack of the Show\"\" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.\"\\n603,\"Worst DCOM I have seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The acting and story was fine, but the effects SUCKED!<br /><br />They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene in which I was excited.<br /><br />Overall, I found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. <br /><br />I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.<br /><br />4/10\"\\n604,\"its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a movie which has no story,again shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of times,i think this is to much,pretty zinta spouse to act the character of a Pakistani girl i didn\\'t know that there is enough facilities in Pakistan for the Pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities??!! and also i didn\\'t know that an Indian can cross the March\\'s between both countries,go to Pakistan and start dancing and singing may be Pakistani soldier\\'s were sleeping!!!!!!!!!\"\\n605,\"Some people may call \"\"Cooley High\"\" the same sort of thing as \"\"American Graffiti\"\", but I wouldn\\'t. For starters, in \"\"AG\"\", everyone was white, whereas in \"\"CH\"\" they\\'re all black. Moreover, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there\\'s never any dad around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.<br /><br />One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in the real sense of the word.\"\\n606,\"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they\\'re both faultless. Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.\"\\n607,\"This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some years later, I recognised him from Kline\\'s portrayal. Denzel Washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever.<br /><br />I urge you to watch this. It is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.\"\\n608,\"I have recently seen this production on DVD. It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a \"\"Jane Eyre\"\" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. <br /><br />All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way, some even leave out the \"\"Rivers\"\" family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the \"\"Gypsy\"\" scene done correctly.<br /><br />The casting is perfect, Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book \"\"small plain and dark\"\" and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester, portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time, like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted, his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).<br /><br />Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!\"\\n609,\"In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it\\'s a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn\\'t get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie\\'s boss). I\\'m so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you haven\\'t!!\"\\n610,\"PREY <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion...<br /><br />Despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, Norman J. Warren\\'s follow-up to SATAN\\'S SLAVE (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne\\'s eye-catching cinematography), though Annan\\'s discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and \\'left\\' under mysterious circumstances. Stokes\\' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. There\\'s an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to \\'emasculate\\' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women\\'s clothing, though Stokes\\' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.<br /><br />In the early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially Annan\\'s final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). Excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by Warren\\'s unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film\\'s budgetary shortcomings. Originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY.\"\\n611,\"The tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of Scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick) a former paratrooper in the British Army, is the local dentist, he\\'s not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. The islands serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp Inskip(Maurice Roëves) at the islands police station, Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP, Dr Goudry, for closer inspection. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin, Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.<br /><br />Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. With a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn\\'t work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports of UFO\\'s and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikin\\'s idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.<br /><br />The Nightmare Man is based on the novel, Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire, it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blake\\'s 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. The Nightmare Man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that I enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to Camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. There is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point. If there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its POV for the killings, an acceptable cliché on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it\\'s a fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. Imrie, never one i\\'ve taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production. The outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.\"\\n612,\"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven\\'t seen either movie and want to but don\\'t want the spoilers, please don\\'t read this review!<br /><br />While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe\\'s Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar\\'s Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. It\\'s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you\\'ll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon\\'s character).<br /><br />Also, the tie-in with the photography/\"\"You could be a model\"\" comment at the end was totally lame and didn\\'t add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can\\'t believe they made a Cruel Intentions 3.\"\\n613,\"This movie is ridiculous. It\\'s attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. The whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it\\'s a comedy. Truly is bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch it to realize there\\'s a few jokes here and there going on but either way they\\'re all inside jokes amongst themselves. This is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. It really is a very pointless movie.Their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. Unless you want to be bored out of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.\"\\n614,\"In dramatising Wilde\\'s novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian\\'s essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson\\'s \"\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\"\", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route. Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.<br /><br />The actors in this BBC movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as George Sanders, in his role really projecting Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You\\'ll suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don\\'t get to see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to display.<br /><br />It\\'s a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.\"\\n615,\"It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have\\'s have not\\'s. I got it way back in the beginning. Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I actually felt like I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. Teenage Caveman, which Larry didn\\'t write but did direct, was terrible. But at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn\\'t take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.\"\\n616,\"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its \"\"Sita\"\" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky\\'s \"\"An Unmarried Woman.\"\" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. <br /><br />Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however, compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta\\'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers.<br /><br />Ms Das, Ms Azmi, Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sen\\'s \"\"Khandar\"\", Gautam Ghose\\'s \"\"Paar\"\", Benegal\\'s \"\"Ankur\"\") a brilliance notably absent in this film. Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. All in all, the film\\'s strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema. I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays.\"\\n617,\"All the way though i was thinking to myself \"\"Oh god why!\"\" At the very beginning i thought \"\"Right it might be average,\"\" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious.<br /><br />Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right.<br /><br />Why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn\\'t make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all.<br /><br />You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh shes behind her ... didn\\'t see that one coming *yawns*.<br /><br />Surely these people must have thought to... oh i don\\'t know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short \"\"Oh thank god.\"\" If you haven\\'t already, don\\'t waste your\\' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!\"\\n618,\"At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. Not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.<br /><br />After losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director Murali K. Thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri\\'s attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.<br /><br />With heavy and hard subject matter, Thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis\\'s. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. The factor on Thalluri\\'s talent is his subtlety. He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. It verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.<br /><br />2:37 has a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants film Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. Like Sant, Thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. A defining point to Elephant was its ethereal ambiance. With spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. While there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level Sant couldn\\'t reach. As time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster.<br /><br />The real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. Though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. With unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers.<br /><br />Compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film.\"\\n619,\"The quote above just about says it all for \"\"Slipstream\"\". I should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided I ought to be fair and give it a chance. I won\\'t watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie, I\\'m sure it will set a record.<br /><br />Some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton\\'s character has hijacked Hamill\\'s prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question though is why didn\\'t he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman.<br /><br />If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then I suppose you\\'ll find something of interest here. But you can\\'t convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxton\\'s character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there\\'s some hidden meaning here, you\\'re really stretching.<br /><br />Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming \"\"The End\"\" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. Yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the film was keeping them afloat.\"\\n620,\"Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand at visual comedy, successfully leads this Hal Roach road show which tenders a fast-moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting, employing a large number of Roach\\'s reliable performers. Although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, sunny Jack Haley stars as Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to Hollywood, where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves, star-struck Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers using the entire M-G-M studio as his set, does so here as Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by a would-be paramour, cinema star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), to behind-the-scenes action of, naturally, a musical comedy, featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes, including their well-known skit involving a tiny harmonica, and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On balance, one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star, a role which he largely creates, and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeley\\'s filmic spectacles.\"\\n621,\"The jokes are obvious, the gags are corny, and the characters are walking characatures - but I couldn\\'t stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of this one, and I recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment. It contains many quotable moments, and some of the best sight-gags I\\'ve seen to this day. If you\\'ve had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one on your way home Friday night to give your weekend a good start.\"\\n622,\"These slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.<br /><br />The valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.<br /><br />The film has one Peach of a line... \"\"He\\'s no Angel....\"\" when he in fact IS Angel!!! Watching Buffy reruns will never be the same!<br /><br />The cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. Sorry but NO!<br /><br />The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(<br /><br />Essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the \"\"borrowing\"\" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. Psycho\\'s shower scene is tributed, along with Halloween\\'s \"\"masking\"\". <br /><br />Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as I know!!!<br /><br />Light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. If it was a choice between The Hole and this though, choose The Hole. Slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. A very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!!\"\\n623,\"The only reason I gave this episode of \"\"Masters of Horror\"\" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good, and it wasn\\'t shot on VHS. The story, the dialog, and the plot are ridiculous. <br /><br />Talking / Driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war! Give me a break! What next, zombies who come back to go skydiving? Maybe zombies who come back to host QVC shows? <br /><br />I never supported the Iraq war, but I do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and \"\"Homecoming\"\" was disrespectful in that it mocks the TRUE horror of war. <br /><br />With zombies being mass produced in today\\'s market... this is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment. How \"\"Homecoming\"\" made it onto \"\"Masters of Horror\"\" is beyond me.\"\\n624,\"Like most, I thought \\'another crocodile movie\\'. So far we\\'ve had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that\\'s new? Where both those films were about action and violence, this one\\'s about fear and tension.<br /><br />The performances aren\\'t Oscar-worthy when there\\'s nothing going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it\\'s like torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don\\'t really behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective it\\'s a stretch to say you\\'ll enjoy this movie. It\\'ll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as The Passion of the Christ.\"\\n625,\"There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick\\'s abundance of clichés throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.<br /><br />I\\'d read about Elizabeth Berkly\\'s awful performance in the equally-awful \"\"Showgirls,\"\" which I\\'ve never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime\\'s worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn\\'t have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn\\'t a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.<br /><br />The principal\\'s handling of Liz\\'s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband\\'s initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny\\'s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally-challenged).<br /><br />The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.<br /><br />Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you\\'d rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the \"\"Law and Order\"\" series\\', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on \"\"Lifetime.\"\"<br /><br />Finally, I found a kind of \"\"story within a story\"\" fascination with Josh\\'s concoction of his being the \"\"victim\"\" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from \"\"F\"\" to \"\"F-minus.\"\"<br /><br />This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour\\'s blank film in the camera. <br /><br />But the writer(s) here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally \"\"resolved\"\" and \"\"righted,\"\" this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any \"\"real world\"\" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.<br /><br />This one\\'s a 2* presentation; the second \"\"*\"\" because it does have some mild \"\"fascination.\"\"\"\\n626,\"If you haven\\'t seen this yet, you really should, on DVD. I can\\'t believe how much I enjoyed it! It is amazingly realistic and believable. True, much of it is speculated, and I would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there aren\\'t many of them), but it handles everything quite well with a \"\"Cruel Mother Nature\"\" theme. It will remind you of the nature programs that you\\'ve seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are Dinosaurs. They act natural; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. You will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others.<br /><br />For the most part, the effects are excellent. At times they will look a little too much like CGI\\'s, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. In some cases, you will actually be convinced that you\\'ve seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. I was most disappointed with the T-Rex, however, which looked a little too computer generated at times.<br /><br />In any case, you should definitely see this production. It is educational, well made, and very entertaining. For what it is, its an A!\"\\n627,\"Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change the channel, it\\'s sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. Its pretty telling that the cast IMDb \"\"credits\"\" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.<br /><br />Bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. It just goes on and on. The movie really has nothing to recommend it. If you\\'re looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won\\'t require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.<br /><br />I hope this film didn\\'t get money from the government for financing, otherwise I\\'m never paying taxes again.\"\\n628,\"Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated by Sadhu\\'s high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu\\'s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.<br /><br />I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making.\"\\n629,\"Let\\'s keep it simple: My two kids were glued to this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. <br /><br />And the Pepsi girl was excellent!<br /><br />And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although she\\'s not in the film very much, so don\\'t get too excited there.<br /><br />Not that\\'s it\\'s really a bad thing, but it is the kind of movie you watch just once. Don\\'t buy the DVD.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the dads.)\"\\n630,\"It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don\\'t judge me... please.<br /><br />We\\'re back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group have made their way onto an island. It doesn\\'t take too long before they encounter a large \"\"reptile\"\", which gobbles up their horse. Soon they\\'re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the \"\"reptile gods.\"\" THE CG sucks; it reminds me of the CG of early console video games. The encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it\\'s just a middling effort.\"\\n631,\"Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was superb. I felt as if i knew the characters. I could almost \\'feel\\' them. They reminded me of people that I knew as a child growing up in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s. Oh, the memories!! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. I have watched this movie so many times, that I can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. I can\\'t even list my favorite part, because I have SO MANY favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and age...and that is Black people loving each other, looking out for each other, respecting each other, caring about each other, and doing all we can to help each other. Gotta go now. I have to go watch it again.\"\\n632,\"Saturday June 3, 6:30pm The Neptune<br /><br />Monday June 5, 4:30pm The Neptune<br /><br />Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as Carlos Saura\\'s brilliant interpretation of Isaac Albeniz\\' masterpiece Iberia Suite. At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve \"\"impressions\"\" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before Saura\\'s camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.\"\\n633,\"As most people I am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that Hollywood makes. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.<br /><br />This movie is a welcome change. It could be classified as romantic comedy for it\\'s genre but don\\'t let that turn you off this movie. This is a very original movie which is not like most things Hollywood produces.<br /><br />If you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so I will not bother going over that. The only movies that come to mind to compare this to are \"\"Interstate 60\"\" and \"\"Art of Travel\"\" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the Hollywood garbage.<br /><br />This is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.<br /><br />Dean\"\\n634,\"Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow. Although the story-line was rather typical of Clara\\'s later silents, I still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy-go-lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! Clara\\'s lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a nice showcase of Clara\\'s ability to make the audience laugh.\"\\n635,\"As the number of Video Nasties I\\'ve yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"\"to rent\"\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He\\'s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that\\'s pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it\\'s not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"\"fair\"\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can\\'t recommend this trash to anyone. It\\'s not even the good bad movie. It\\'s just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.\"\\n636,\"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith\\'s gun was cool.\"\\n637,\"I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.<br /><br />The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin won\\'t like her because she\\'s ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeane\\'s character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up \"\"comedienne\"\" and arch-feminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is \"\"anti-feminist\"\" when in fact it\\'s just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. It\\'s interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She\\'d been a feminist and \"\"comedienne\"\" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven\\'s sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman\\'s character Noelle.<br /><br />There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin\\'s character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they\\'ve never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There\\'s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn\\'t ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She\\'s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she\\'s lanky and gaunt looking.<br /><br />I guarantee three things about this film if you\\'ve never watched it:<br /><br />You will know what the ending will be;<br /><br />You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;<br /><br />You will be bored after ten minutes.<br /><br />Watch at your own peril.\"\\n638,This movie has everything typical horror movies lack. Although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers. The only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for Jackzilla. Dare i say oscar winner. This is a perfect date movie. I advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person.\\n639,\"Having just seen Walt Disney\\'s The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one\\'s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short. It does get a little repetitious near the end. Still, Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony.\"\\n640,\"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander\\'s better actors, many of who I have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It\\'s as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine \"\"Under Siege\"\" meets \"\"The Love Boat\"\", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor, I recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.\"\\n641,\"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. \"\"Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life.\"\" How true these words are. Watson\\'s Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she\\'s the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. <br /><br />The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one\\'s professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don\\'t want to face the consequence; one ironically can\\'t believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /><br />The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It\\'s not sensational or complex as another film \"\"Where the Truth Lies\"\" 2005. Credits due to Fellowes\\' writing and the nuanced performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. And following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning\\'s seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /><br />You might say there\\'s no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in \"\"Separate Lies,\"\" yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner (of filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski\\'s Trois Couleurs, especially: Bleu 1993.) This is a British film you just might not want to miss. <br /><br />Emily Watson (Anne, the wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defence 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /><br />Tom Wilkinson (James, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 opposite Laura Linney. <br /><br />Rupert Everett (Bill): He is simply delightful in \"\"My Best Friend\\'s Wedding\"\" 1997 opposite Julia Roberts and marvelous in \"\"An Ideal Husband\"\" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, an Oscar Wilde play. Recently as Sherlock Holmes with Ian Hart as Dr. Watson, in PBS Mystery: Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stockings 2004 TV. <br /><br />Linda Bassett (Maggie): she was very effective as Ella Khan opposite Om Puri in \"\"East is East\"\" 1999.\"\\n642,\"I am amazed with some of the reviews of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is awful. The plot is extremely lazy. It is not scary either. People out there who think that because it stars Sarah Michelle Geller it is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It didn\\'t scare me nor interest me either. Let\\'s face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans. The films that are coming out of Hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer. They\\'re just being churned out\"\\n643,\"Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. Angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela heads to Mexico but takes the disc with her. While she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes overtures to her. She falls for them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the USA, Jack makes things difficult. He changes Angela\\'s identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack at his own game? This very exciting movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. The script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today\\'s world. The costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. And, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as Angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to \"\"net\"\" a very good evening of entertainment.\"\\n644,\"I rented the DVD in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But it\\'s pretty much just more terror-tainment.<br /><br />While the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you\\'re taking the word of the producers - there\\'s no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. Not one.<br /><br />The acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of \\'hot shot\\' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. There may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad Hollywood stereotype smell to it.<br /><br />IMDb\\'s user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and I have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever I can.<br /><br />I wish I had on this one.\"\\n645,\"Look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. But you must see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN\\' hot and a great little actress to boot! These types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a Coke and putting in this film. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree.. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. The movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. The others are clearly not in her league. This is not the Exorcist but as I said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see!\"\\n646,\"It wasn\\'t until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer/star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making . This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things , a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic . You know when you\\'ve been painting a wall until you\\'re completely bored ? Well that\\'s the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they\\'re swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner <br /><br />The plot centres on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it . You can\\'t really blame them since there\\'s few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks , though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair ! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents <br /><br />After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( And no that\\'s not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who can\\'t read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them . This is what I don\\'t get - Even though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising they\\'re charging towards a gaping ravine ! Isn\\'t this somewhat illogical ? It\\'s also something of a revealing error since the horses , chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures <br /><br />Anyway the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory . But who needs Moshe Dayan , Arik Sharon or God when you\\'ve got an idiotic enemy who can\\'t see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall ?\"\\n647,\"I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn\\'t help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen\\'s work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop\\'s most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson\\'s character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.<br /><br />I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson\\'s performance but I am a bit bias, I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen\\'s stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson\\'s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br /><br />Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br /><br />Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br /><br />In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor, laugh and be merry.<br /><br />Needless to say if you enjoy Allen\\'s work watch it. If not watch something else...\"\\n648,\"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his \"\"vision\"\" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />I\\'m sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.\"\\n649,\"1983\\'s \"\"Frightmare\"\" is an odd little film. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic \\'30s/\\'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding \\'80s slasher genre. It isn\\'t totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named \"\"Conrad Ratzoff.\"\" At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he\\'s shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol\\' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he couldn\\'t be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death\\'s door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.<br /><br />It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad\\'s grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an \\'80s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad\\'s body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime, Mrs. Ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband\\'s body, has called in a psychic friend to try and \"\"reach\"\" Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasn\\'t a very nice guy in life, it\\'s not much of a stretch to assume that he won\\'t be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students\\' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying \"\"Hello? Is anyone there?\"\" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we\\'re in an \\'80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad\\'s body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.<br /><br />I can\\'t really recommend \"\"Frightmare\"\" to anyone who didn\\'t grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the \\'80s. \"\"Modern Horror\"\" fans will doubtlessly find \"\"Frightmare\"\" incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from \"\"Frightmare.\"\" Fans of Jeffrey (\"\"Re-Animator\"\") Combs may also want to check it out, as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.<br /><br />I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward\\'s \"\"Vault of Horror\"\" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I\\'m told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma, which seems appropriate. If you\\'re a Troma kind of person then \"\"Frightmare\"\" will be right up your alley.\"\\n650,\"People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie didn\\'t have the big budget, there\\'s no special effects, no car chases and there\\'s no explosions. Actually reality doesn\\'t have much of these either. At least not in my life. <br /><br />This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I\\'m neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain.<br /><br />So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. <br /><br />Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden\\'s life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. <br /><br />Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his \\'Harvey\\' and Kiefer\\'s \\'Mickey\\' enhances the oppositeness of their characters.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, \\'Mrs Ramsay\\', I\\'m sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!!<br /><br />There\\'s a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them.\"\\n651,\"I think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there, I actually thought quite the same as you do. But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do, I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don\\'t think that the material given to them can really show that, as I think this material isn\\'t very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don\\'t think that you, before you haven\\'t seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! And I shouldn\\'t have judged over them as well before I met them, but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it. So please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven\\'t seen them doing there job.\"\\n652,\"As usual, I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven\\'t watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. There is no story!! A group of guys meander around Iraq. One day they are here diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Bagdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn\\'t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think is going to happen??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn\\'t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look \"\"artsy\"\". And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent \"\"Full Metal Jacket\"\", \"\"Deerhunter\"\" or \"\"Platoon\"\". Don\\'t waste time or money on this boring movie!\"\\n653,\"A group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other\\'s Jeep mysteriously won\\'t start). One of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. When the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice Mr. Slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. He goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about \"\"Davy\"\", his brother who is lurking about and isn\\'t all there. Of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70\\'s genre in it\\'s twist of an ending. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same. This is a gem if you can find it; I had taped it off of cable when I was younger, and walking through a used video store I spotted a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts won\\'t be disappointed either. Best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!)<br /><br />I gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.\"\\n654,\"Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they\\'re essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. \"\"Tommy Boy\"\" is a character right from \"\"SNL\"\" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn\\'t know anything.<br /><br />David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He\\'s paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy\\'s Business.<br /><br />The plot, for starters, is really faulty. The whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be \"\"funny\"\" together.<br /><br />The movie\\'s biggest \"\"influence\"\" is the 1987 comedy classic \"\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles.\"\" That movie is great because the plot isn\\'t stale and recycled. It\\'s basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But it\\'s real, dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are far more real. \"\"Tommy Boy\"\" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don\\'t care about what\\'s happening on-screen. \"\"PTA\"\" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - \"\"Tommy Boy\"\" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn\\'t dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.<br /><br />The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from \"\"PTA\"\" and it\\'s eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie.<br /><br />Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - I\\'ve never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn\\'t changed my mind. Spade\\'s given very little to do, serving as the movie\\'s most thankless character.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy\\'s Business. The ending is a joke, and not in a \"\"har-har funny\"\" way. More like a \"\"oh god are they serious?!\"\" way.<br /><br />Some people dig it, that\\'s cool. But I just can\\'t get into it, nor do I appreciate all the stuff it \"\"borrows\"\" from - not just counting \"\"PT&A\"\" - without any credit whatsoever.\"\\n655,\"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film.\"\\n656,\"Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David \"\"The Big Apple\"\") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow hopeless romantic Gary (The main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it\\'s ending. If you haven\\'t been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. L.A.V. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it\\'s genre.\"\\n657,\"I loved this show from it\\'s first airing, and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. I say bring it back, I know all of the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD\\'s, I am. I hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only watch one show on that channel now, (Ghost Hunters), but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too.\"\\n658,\"I didn\\'t know what to except so I think it was a lot better not having excepted much. Don\\'t get my wrong its not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. You can tell that it has been an act of love for her. The acting (outside of Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. There was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though I don\\'t feel it greatly detracts for one\\'s ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say go for it. The gag reel was fun, I won\\'t spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the film then check out The Pink Mirror, a film also done by Jagged Edge. I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.\"\\n659,\"Did the first travesty actually make money? This is another sequel (along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT) that no one asked for. But we\\'ve received it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. It\\'s also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) To think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck, and Warden. Did they need the money that much?\"\\n660,\"I was never so bored in my life. Hours of pretentious, self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems. It\\'s like watching lizards molt. Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy. If you have insomnia, rent this.\"\\n661,\"This movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.<br /><br />Just remember this: When you\\'re watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... THIS is the formula that they are using. THIS is what makes zombie movies so great.<br /><br />And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.<br /><br />All in all, it doesn\\'t linger. There\\'s never a point where you think to yourself \"\"c\\'mon, get on with it\"\"... it moves quick and corners nicely. This is the sporty, little Italian number of zombie flicks.<br /><br />So awful, it\\'s wonderful! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.<br /><br />As a great trivia note: If you\\'re watching it on DVD, you\\'ll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... Well... that\\'s because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.\"\\n662,\"The Ladies Man is laugh out loud funny, with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written).<br /><br />Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role.<br /><br />Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you\\'ll find in any comedy out there.<br /><br />It is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round.<br /><br />I am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4.7 /10 and i urge you to vote! <br /><br />And remember kids- \"\"Theres more motion in the ocean\"\"\"\\n663,\"when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn\\'t just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.<br /><br />The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.<br /><br />To me the film feels like unfinished. Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don\\'t know but that\\'s how i feel about the movie.<br /><br />But overall it\\'s a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt.\"\\n664,\"A flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a \\'forbidden planet.\\' What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.<br /><br />On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare\\'s Tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its The Tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? <br /><br />Underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek.<br /><br />Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.<br /><br />This is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi I like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Trek\\'s original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it. <br /><br />Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen\\'s performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. Though they certainly got most of the film quite right.\"\\n665,\"I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that \"\"I, Robot\"\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too).<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \"\"retread\"\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith\\'s character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).<br /><br />\"\"I, Robot\"\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today\\'s audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood\\'s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don\\'t think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today\\'s standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners.\"\\n666,\"This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century.<br /><br />This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc.<br /><br />Good movie with a good message.\"\\n667,\"I have bought the complete season of Surface. watched it in 3 days! I was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile\\'s sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. You could connect on so many levels it\\'s fascinating.<br /><br />I find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.<br /><br />Am sadden, that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.<br /><br />Love the show very much. For those who haven\\'t watched Surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\\n668,\"This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. I found them pretty bad: it just wasn\\'t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for \"\"the set\"\". They do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt.<br /><br />If you\\'re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />The action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. It made the movie look short, and that\\'s certainly a pro for this particular movie.\"\\n669,\"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It\\'s her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it\\'s his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you\\'ll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it\\'s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you\\'re not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It\\'s their skill as actors that attracts you, they don\\'t rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special.\"\\n670,\"When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. She has beautiful and charming body. When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body... i think male have hard to resist....i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queen.I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions aren\\'t conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I\\'m a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can\\'t help it; sorry for that. \\'Raincoat\\' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed\"\\n671,They\\'ve shown i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very tired of it. The bad acting isn\\'t enough... The story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists. I love the original from 1953 so I recommend you to go and rent that one instead. Because this one is such a bore.\\n672,\"Having seen Carlo Lizzani\\'s documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied... I faced a need for critical opinion, which I generally don\\'t like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. But when I read the reviews already written on this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes don\\'t know what to criticize. Therefore, to be clear, I\\'ll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about Visconti before his director\\'s career and latter one about Visconti the director. <br /><br />The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. His effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents\\' divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino was brought up as a real count of Milano: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For instance, his father\\'s splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. There is also an emphasis on Visconti\\'s crucial visit in Paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people (\"\"left wingers\"\") who later had impact on his style and message in art. That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first sight). <br /><br />However, the part about his director\\'s career, which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director\\'s death in 1976, is poorly executed. His movies are not discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, such movies like IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like the interviews of his. Moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... There is no mention of significant works of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE, there are no interviews with eminent cast Burt Lancaster. A mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made. There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. Franco Zeffirelli, though I appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. For instance, he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. Therefore, I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /><br />What I find a strong point here are footage interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we may get his own opinion about his works. For instance, I very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG.<br /><br />I believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this doc. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of the director. Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people\\'s emotions and viewpoints into stone... 4/10\"\\n673,\"Time is precious. This film isn\\'t. I must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time.<br /><br />The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: Is this the film the critics are raving about? What a piece of crap!<br /><br />The hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. Get it?<br /><br />The acting is superb.<br /><br />The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. The characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next.<br /><br />I have had more fun doing the laundry.\"\\n674,\"worst. movie. ever made. EVER. I have no words to say about it.. other then it truly had no point, no plot, no... anything. sheer crap!!! I don\\'t know how everyone in the movie didn\\'t shoot them shelves after watching it.... .... .... ... .. I love vampire flicks and mysteries, and alternate abstract outside the box films, and.... this was non of those. I mean what the crap!!! I cant even tell you what the film was about cuz I still don\\'t know, and I just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it... bottom line.. I think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs. thats the only thing I got from this film. please don\\'t watch this... I mean for a \"\" sultry sensual vampire flick\"\" there wasn\\'t even the to be expected nudity you\\'d get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point.... this movie blows. go set yourself on fire instead.... .. ..\"\\n675,\"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It\\'s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don\\'t know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood \"\"idjits\"\" wouldn\\'t have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don\\'t be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don\\'t mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you\\'re going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.\"\\n676,I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching) It is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again. Buy a copy now it is a classic!!!!\\n677,\"I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I\\'m going to assume that one\\'s level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one\\'s level of acceptance of Joseph\\'s story.<br /><br />However, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Being that I\\'m LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started! Anyway, I\\'m told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.\"\\n678,\"Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. Sound like anyone you know?<br /><br />From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe\\'s civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.<br /><br />The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.<br /><br />In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All this does is to humanise him. When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As dictator, he inspects his subordinates\\' technical innovations which don\\'t work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact, Hynkel\\'s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.<br /><br />In truth, Chaplin\\'s day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer\\'s face, \"\"your cause is doomed to failure because it\\'s built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people\"\"? And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of \\'silent\\' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).<br /><br />Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. \"\"Gee, ain\\'t I cute?\"\" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over. Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn\\'t come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature. The \\'wouldn\\'t it be wonderful?\\' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.<br /><br />Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film\\'s underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.<br /><br />And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?\"\\n679,\"\"\"Milo\"\" is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.Do we really need more slashers?I for one think we already have more than enough.I guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that\\'s also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.A long time ago,he drowned but that didn\\'t bother him and he still kills people(\"\"Friday the 13th\"\",what\\'s that?).One day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,Milo comes to pay them a visit.Through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milo\\'s dull,I mean dark secret.She and her friends have been dying to know.Once discovered,Milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn\\'t it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.The acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him that,but some movies just can\\'t be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.\"\\n680,\"This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE!! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS!!! In parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,I have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way!\"\\n681,\"Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980\\'s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80\\'s, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70\\'s \"\"The Town the Dreaded Sundown\"\".\"\\n682,\"Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature Mickey, it is in fact his third, but it doesn\\'t matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. The story sees Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and Minnie Mouse missing the boat. Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her crank it\\'s tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until Pete comes along again to stop him, making Mickey peel potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!\"\\n683,\"Highly regarded at release, but since rather neglected. Immense importance in the history of performing arts. A classic use of embedded plots. One of my favourite films. Why hasn\\'t the soundtrack been re-released?\"\\n684,\"The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband\\'s corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman\\'s head, to frame the killer for her husband\\'s murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman\\'s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old \"\"Santa kills\"\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she\\'s-been-cheating-with routine. It\\'s essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There\\'s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show\\'s highlights.\"\\n685,\"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read \\'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family\\'s church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God\\'s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego\\'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny\\'s \\'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?\\' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word \\'pray\\' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, \\'prey\\'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say \\'prayer\\' (\\'preyer\\' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn\\'t There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.<br /><br />Maybe Robert Whitlow\\'s book is better.\"\\n686,\"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford\\'s films. At two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a \"\"greatest hits\"\" performance with bits of Mary the innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary the spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character\\'s illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Mary\\'s.\"\\n687,\"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $5 on VHS. She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That\\'s right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa doesn\\'t make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don\\'t get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.\"\\n688,\"Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />Although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. For example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80\\'s, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. None of that is in here.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various people\\'s points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. <br /><br />The criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there\\'s an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. It\\'s morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />So, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it\\'s pretty disappointing.\"\\n689,\"Considering this film was released 8 years before I was born, I don\\'t feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time. Back in January of 98 though, I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino film fest held in Austin,Texas. The particular theme of films this night was \"\"Neglected 70\\'s Crime Films\"\" and boy was her right. \"\"The Gravy Train(or The Dion Brothers, as it appeared this print)\"\" was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. I hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. In the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.\"\\n690,\"The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the \"\"big time\"\" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn\\'t about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it\\'s about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be \"\"discovered\"\" back then.\"\\n691,\"First, I realize that a \"\"1\"\" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it\\'s not bad in a self-aware, over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply misses its mark on every count. **Contains possible spoilers** The dialog is completely disingenuous. The continuity is so deliberate it\\'s painful. Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love, and with his final word the flamenco dancers start. The mock-shock of what\\'s her name (see? I don\\'t even remember her character\\'s name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. Vegetable carts gone flying. Cars crashing into each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People nearly being hit, but remarkably, no one is. Oh, that\\'s right... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times, is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn\\'t notice him there. Hmmm. <br /><br />It\\'s becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you\\'d think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing. Now there\\'s a novel idea. <br /><br />My suggestion: don\\'t see this film. Don\\'t rent the DVD. Don\\'t watch it on cable. There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied.\"\\n692,\"Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says \"\"lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black, then walk away\"\". The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is funny, and the show contains many such types of situation, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of the humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier. Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers, divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all.\"\\n693,\"The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H. G. Wells\\' great novel, \"\"War of the Worlds\"\". This is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th Century, 1900 \\x85 using Wells\\' original setting, in and near Woking, England.<br /><br />IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as \"\"spoilers\"\". That might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature, so let\\'s get right to the chase. The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease, against which they have no immunity. If that\\'s a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.<br /><br />This film, which follows Wells\\' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented \\x96 in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th Century photography. Although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). Colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. At other times, colors are washed out. These variations are typical of early films, which didn\\'t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on \\x96 as you\\'ll see on occasion here. The special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s \\x96 and yet the Martians and their machines are very much as Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic \"\"feel\"\". Some of effects are really awkward \\x96 such as the destruction of Big Ben. The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. Some aspects of Victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.<br /><br />This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells\\' original narrative \\x96 as has been noted. Viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. Wells\\' description of the Martians \\x96 a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles \\x96 is effectively portrayed. When the Martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how Wells described them. Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural England \\x96 plus a few scenes in London (involving the Narrator\\'s brother). The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (Big Ben), but at least doesn\\'t dwell unduly on the devastation of London.<br /><br />The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. The Narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what Wells terms \"\"the rout of Mankind\"\". He encounters a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the Martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. Wells adds that after eating they set up \"\"a prolonged and cheerful hooting\"\". The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate \\x96 who revives just as the Martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; British curates are so often utterly insufferable).<br /><br />This film lasts almost 3 hours, going through Wells\\' story in welcome detail. It\\'s about time the author got his due \\x96 in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. A word about the acting: Don\\'t expect award-winning performances. They\\'re not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. Most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana, in his 2nd film. The Curate is John Kaufman \\x96 also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. The Brother (\"\"Henderson\"\") is played with some conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film. The Artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by James Lathrop in his first film.<br /><br />This is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it. Despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. If you want to see H. G. Wells\\' War of the Worlds \\x96 and not some wholly distorted version of it \\x96 see this film!\"\\n694,\"Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I have to say #1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp\\'s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. I imagine that, as one poster suggested, Christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at Shemp\\'s possibly dying.<br /><br />Another character who helps this stand out is the Goon. His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, who\\'s going to complain. Not I.\"\\n695,\"Okay this is stupid,they say their not making another Nightmare film,that this is the \"\"last\"\" one...And what do they do?They go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was BAD,but why do they play us. Anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.The plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!Id say. I hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.Again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. How can they have gone this far?Didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?Yet they make this?Its all bout the money,DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES.<br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: Had potential with plot.<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible acting/lack of deaths/Too funny to be classified as horror/very confusing.\"\\n696,\"Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /><br />Any way, I haven\\'t seen anything like this before so it was crazy! Of course that\\'s a good thing. It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! Like chicken little,, the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying, \"\"Twas beauty who killed the beast\"\", War of the worlds scene and more. Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one. Also, how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /><br />However some parts don\\'t fit. Like in the original lion king, weren\\'t Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar? In this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. Ther\\'s more, the reason being why Pumbaa isn\\'t so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it\\'s just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anybody realise that only Timonn\\'s story was told, whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks?<br /><br />But apart from that , IT\"\"S GREAT!\"\\n697,\"Finally was there released a good Modesty Blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the \"\"real\"\" story. I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O\\'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is. It is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale. Some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from \\'66 then is this a magnificent movie. So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story.\"\\n698,\"By now, the game\\'s stale, right?<br /><br />The jokes have been done. Its all over. The creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />The game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks. Sure, they\\'re all rehash, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter.<br /><br />The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. The ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select \"\"You don\\'t need to see my identification.\"\" Its worth the price of the game by itself.\"\\n699,\"I decided to watch this movie because I\\'d not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I\\'m sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog \\x96 and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.<br /><br />The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What\\'s that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure... <br /><br />In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples\\' worsening financial status, their troubles with John\\'s live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, John\\'s diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples\\' angst about their marriage, the baby\\'s sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.<br /><br />How many more clichéd situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There wasn\\'t much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate.<br /><br />This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn \\x96 during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />So, it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol\\' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative \\x96 all against the backdrop of the \"\"average\"\" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /><br />And, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938 \\x96 soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many here would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.<br /><br />However, I\\'m glad I saw it \\x96 as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But, I\\'ll have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you\\'ve seen all of Stewart\\'s movies; otherwise, don\\'t bother.\"\\n700,\"Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there\\'s nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood(it\\'s suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90\\'T.V film.It\\'s even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So Rest in peace Bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:Zombi 3, Robowar,Rats, l\\'altro inferno,Virus, Cruel jaws and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco\\'s spirit\\'s new film, pass on this one.But if you don\\'t know this nice artisan\\'s career track down his old films and have fun.\"\\n701,\"I Enjoyed Watching This Well Acted Movie Very Much!It Was Well Acted,Particularly By Actress Helen Hunt And Actors Steven Weber And Jeff Fahey.It Was A Very Interesting Movie,Filled With Drama And Suspense,From The Beginning To The Very End.I Reccomend That Everyone Take The Time To Watch This Made For Television Movie,It Is Excellent And Has Great Acting!!\"\\n702,\"Hypothetical situations abound, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. One lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local Indian tribe \\x96 until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. Alan, a man of the book, is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way \\x96 until, Jeri Ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer \\x96 Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. Even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.<br /><br />Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled \"\"The Quiet Earth\"\" (which I will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. With a borrowed story, I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director\\'s techniques to attempt to find his own. He opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. Sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to \"\"how\"\" or better yet \"\"why\"\" these select few survived. A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. The juxtaposition would have been like \"\"Shawn of the Dead\"\", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a \"\"made-for-TV\"\" program. Listening to the audio commentary, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn\\'t as happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this does make for decent independent film-making, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston\\'s case, it was the latter.<br /><br />I must admit, David Arnott\\'s portrayal of Alan hooked me. He played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. He was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, I cannot say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery\\'s first film, and it was obvious \\x96 I mean \\x96 really really obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn\\'t the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art. She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. Confused? Again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. Even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or \"\"ohhh, look at that color\"\" moment. While her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. This was her first film, so can I be too harsh? <br /><br />Overall, this film felt like it was missing something. I though the idea was strong \\x96 the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of \"\"funny\"\" is different, so that is why I couldn\\'t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found \"\"hysterical\"\". His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average. His film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money \\x96 the was in essence, the bank for \"\"The Last Man\"\". Don\\'t get your hopes up for any classic Avery moments.<br /><br />Don\\'t expect more from Ralston \\x96 and that is how I will end it.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****\"\\n703,\"<br /><br />I must admit, I was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of \\'Cut\\' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found \\'Cut\\' to not only be the best of the genre Australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late.<br /><br />My only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it\\'s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in EVERY possible cliche of the horror genre they could. I am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.<br /><br />And of course, there was the gore.<br /><br />The use of the \\'customised\\' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. In short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.<br /><br />The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell (\\'The Castle\\') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician.<br /><br />All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.<br /><br />Loved it. Go see it!\"\\n704,\"I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because whenever I\\'m shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. In this movie a former doctor, who\\'s just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the Purgatory Flats. And, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. He meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. But there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. To know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. I\\'ll just tell you that it\\'s slightly reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.\"\\n705,\"Like anyone else who bought this, I was duped by the \"\"20 pieces of extreme gore\"\" and \"\"banned in 20 countries\"\" or whatever it says in the box. I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The revolutionized make-up effects in the 80\\'s. Today, you don\\'t need them as everything is done on computer. But computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. But I digress.<br /><br />Watching fantastically gory films like Fulci\\'s Gates to Hell or even Savini\\'s crowning achievement, Friday the 13th the Final Chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. You can\\'t tell the difference between reality and magic.<br /><br />I can\\'t imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. If that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. You don\\'t see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords.<br /><br />The gore? Well, it\\'s here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. A man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. The scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. Maybe it\\'s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but I was expecting a bit more. Call me sick or twisted, but isn\\'t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? I honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.<br /><br />Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe. If you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00, you will feel cheated.<br /><br />3/10\"\\n706,\"I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. Familiar to millions as the Lt. on Law and Order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO\\'s Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.<br /><br />The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s from Atlanta\\'s Sweet Auburn to New York\\'s Harlem. But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny\\'s boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny\\'s relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day.\"\\n707,\"This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn\\'t come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan\\'s straight man. I\\'ve read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a \"\"facilitator\"\". Much like \"\"Grosse Pointe Blank\"\", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.\"\\n708,\"As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very \\'of its age\\', in the 1960\\'s. To me (someone born in the 1980\\'s) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but I am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th \\'60\\'s. I expected drugs galore with th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of \\'amatuerish\\' which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. My only good opinion of this is that I didn\\'t waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.\"\\n709,\"Watch the Original with the same title from 1944! This made for TV movie, is just god-awful! Although it does use (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn\\'t work! Is it the acting, the poor directing? OK so it\\'s made for TV, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially as you\\'ll be spoiled to the plot and won\\'t enjoy the original as much, as if you\\'ve watched it first! <br /><br />There are a few things that are different from the original (it\\'s shorter for once), but all are for the worse! The actors playing the parts here, just don\\'t fit the bill! You just don\\'t believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original? If you want, only watch it after you\\'ve seen the original and even then you\\'ll be very brave, if you watch it through! It\\'s almost sacrilege!\"\\n710,\"Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film. It is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. I didn\\'t know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70\\'s soft-core peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South. But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film\\'s end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin(you\\'ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War - particularly in the South. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely, young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin(Amy)have emotional/sexual ties to Eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This might be(except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel\\'s best film. It certainly is one of Eastwood\\'s best REAL performances. page is always so very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent. the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing. And what happens to Eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film.\"\\n711,\"Anyone who lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film. It is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a \"\"spring break movie\"\" PLUS it makes fun of the college film genre. It\\'s funny, it\\'s got a cast to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Writer/ actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I\\'m just repeating myself now...) It will live on with girls who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they\\'re dumb.\"\\n712,\"Arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura(now she\\'s a car!). This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. We get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond\\'s phenom comic strip. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. Don\\'t get me wrong, this isn\\'t a Shakespeare troupe by any means, but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as Flash. He is ably aided by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts Crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us Professor Zarkov((Frank Shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack \"\"Tiny\"\" Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. Lipson steals each and every scene he is in. The plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow. Excellent!\"\\n713,\"I have to say that the events of 9/11 didn\\'t hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers. I was sick of hearing about it. When this was aired on TV a year and a day later, I was bawling my eyes out. It was the first time I had cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I am watching it now on TV, 5 years later, and I am still crying over the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and look where it got them. These two brothers make me want to have been there to help.\"\\n714,\"Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films tend to have flaws - Rear Window looks a little stagey at times, Chris Elliot\\'s character in Groundhog Day doesn\\'t work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /><br />The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it. <br /><br />I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.\"\\n715,\"This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!\"\\n716,\"regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done.. if you\\'re a vampire fanatic, I suppose it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, you others here cant sincerely mean that?. we are to view this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. The story are good, but it doesn\\'t carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. I write this because I chose to see this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but got severely disappointed. don\\'t get me wrong, I thought the blade movies was awesome, and loved the underworld movies, but this characters aren\\'t close. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. this sucks. I might not have gotten so disappointed if I had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is awesome, you don\\'t care about acting or make up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an OK story..\"\\n717,\"I want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can\\'t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.<br /><br />Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g., David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., Krzysztof Kieslowski, and David Cronenberg\\'s later, less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.<br /><br />Not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol\\'s \\'Factory\\' of the \\'60s?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. And, even well into middle-age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has \\'it\\'. Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn\\'t sink into bathos.<br /><br />There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as \"\"Pola X\"\" more charitably. Experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn\\'t work. But Carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. At this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there *any* directors in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? Rating: 3/10.\"\\n718,\"It\\'s hard to praise this film much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. Also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious.<br /><br />I was amazed to see \"\"Marcus Aurelius\"\" in the acting credits, wondering what an ex-Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film! Like \"\"Whoopie Goldberg\"\" it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker.<br /><br />The story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious. If you MUST watch this film, go around to your friend\\'s house and get drunk while doing so - then it\\'ll be enjoyable.\"\\n719,\"I remember going to see the movie in the summer of \\'78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time.<br /><br />Right before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.<br /><br />Because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of \"\"The Fellowship of the Rings\"\" and part of \"\"The Two Towers\"\" -- was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.<br /><br />Its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.<br /><br />This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long TV special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a musical.\"\\n720,\"Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it\\'s frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let\\'s get into his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didn\\'t seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn\\'t like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that\\' no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. It\\'s insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. Cool story that appeals to the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary<br /><br />This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM<br /><br />I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.\"\\n721,\"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski\\'s \"\"Curse of the Komodo\"\", this still sucks...BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in \"\"Curse of the Komodo\"\", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........I don\\'t know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! As in \"\"Curse of the Komodo\"\", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! Also....when i saw this part i laughed hysterically...A KOMANBRA!!! (part man, komodo AND cobra!). Overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had anything to do with a movie....steer clear....to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating \"\"It\\'s almost over..it\\'s almost over...\"\". 0 out of 5.\"\\n722,\"I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn\\'t know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He\\'s definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me was Evie\\'s rather colourful poem. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. In my opinion, watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, I strongly disagree with\"\\n723,\"For Greta Garbo\\'s first talking picture, MGM wisely chose Eugene O\\'Neill\\'s Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie. <br /><br />Also wisely, the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna\\'s father, Chris, and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to \"\"Johnny the Harp\"\" for films so as not to offend). <br /><br />This little change is interesting. Like too many films accused (by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) of being \"\"little more than filmed stage plays,\"\" the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn\\'t be more faithful to the property. By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn\\'t offend anyone, or opening it up because they COULD, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. <br /><br />Fortunately, the respect the studio had for both O\\'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marion\\'s generally sensitive screen adaptation. Wonder of wonders, Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbo\\'s Anna reveals her past on \"\"the farm\"\" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! What the League of Decency must have thought of that! <br /><br />The source play\\'s greatest problem has always been that Chris\\'s friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don\\'t always recognize. <br /><br />The perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbo\\'s Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn\\'t allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O\\'Neill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Laverne\\'s second act appearance in SHOW BOAT. <br /><br />Anna and Marthy\\'s early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other\\'s measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. Not to be missed. <br /><br />ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. It\\'s hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion\\'s original Broadway Chris) could improve on this excellent filming. <br /><br />The internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn\\'t be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the New York harbor).<br /><br />Nearly all Garbo\\'s naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this ANNA Christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA (\"\"Garbo laughs!\"\"), surely stand as her best.<br /><br />O\\'Neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded \"\"sea plays,\"\" should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie, and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.\"\\n724,\"Let me set the scene. It is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We look for a movie that is starting soon and \"\"The Grinch\"\" comes up. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun.<br /><br />Jim Carrey (who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this Ron Howard\\'s best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought this childhood movie to life.<br /><br />The story is based upon the story of the grinch. As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can\\'t stand christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. But one little girl is going to change The Grinch\\'s look on life and on others in a drastic way.<br /><br />Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. She attempts to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.<br /><br />All up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim.<br /><br />\"\\n725,\"As a long-time fan of all the Star Trek series,I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of \"\"flashbacks\"\" featuring Will Riker\\'s exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crewmate\\'s death)was a money-saving device, as were many of their \"\"bottle shows\"\" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur(who also appeared at least twice on the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) also were shortchanged. This was the last episode of second season; thus, the season ended \"\"not with a bang\"\" but with \"\"a whimper.\"\"\"\\n726,\"This TV-series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid. Even though I see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, I can still tell it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember.<br /><br />The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, school still hasn\\'t taught me half of what I know from this show. It also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don\\'t exercise, with nice examples within the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you? :D The cartoon looked nice, very kids friendly of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electric signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking pretty much how you\\'d expect what they should look like in the animated body.<br /><br />This, and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale) were key parts of my childhood. I\\'m so happy I found them here.\"\\n727,\"Fans of the HBO series \"\"Tales From the Crypt\"\" are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.<br /><br />Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.<br /><br />Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of \"\"making up,\"\" and she\\'s horribly burned in a fire, he\\'s reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) <br /><br />But Abbey\\'s never been one to give up without a fight, and that\\'s where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre\\'s favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And that\\'s not to mention that John Esposito\\'s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You don\\'t realize as you\\'re watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you\\'re there.)<br /><br />Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.\"\\n728,\"Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written T.V. Drama\\'s in the 25 years.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular.<br /><br />Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a Nuclear, Biological, and Radiological Terrorist Attack here on American soil.<br /><br />Dirty War should be made into a major motion picture - It\\'s that good! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth.<br /><br />This T.V. drama reveals how British Intelligence (MI5 & MI6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of England\\'s involvement in the Iraq War.<br /><br />The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular.<br /><br />Dirty War is a must see!!!\"\\n729,\"Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn\\'t have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around Adam\\'s inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. Bypass this yawner.\"\\n730,\"This is the Who at their most powerful. Although before the masterwork Who\\'s Next, which would provide anthems like Baba O\\'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again. This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70\\'s.<br /><br />Daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about, Entwistle steady as ever. <br /><br />Moon is great, check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech, and see him playing \"\"side saddle\"\" whilst having a bass drum head replaced!<br /><br />Townsend even looks like he\\'s enjoying himself occasionally!<br /><br />Considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep! <br /><br />There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one.\"\\n731,\"This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. Really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation.<br /><br />We get cliché snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone \"\"tough guy\"\" persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete American Tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. Otherwise it\\'s standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.\"\\n732,\"They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I\\'m sure wasn\\'t released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?\"\\n733,\"That\\'s how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. He plays Tom Sharky, a vice detective who\\'s on the trail of an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he\\'s financing to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy\\'s running for president. This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. Reynolds doesn\\'t do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. He\\'s very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. At times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster\\'s woman. Only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax. Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky\\'s Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim & Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps handles the score with magic. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. Check it out.<br /><br />Score, 8 out of 10 Stars\"\\n734,\"Human Traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a fly-on-the-wall view into their lives (and minds) which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. There are many moments in that every one can relate to, Like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers. The characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie. The situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in, and that is where this film succeeds. The topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other. The story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism. This is a film about people. This is a well written film, with a sound track to die for. D.J\\'s Pete Tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that I have seen in 1999. After watching this film I felt like I had been out partying all weekend. Fantastic Movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - Need I say more!<br /><br />\"\\n735,\"This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch. The second on disc one of D.W. Griffith\\'s \"\"Years of Discovery\"\" DVD set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician giving a Countess the eye (and other things).<br /><br />The Countess\\' husband goes berserk at his wife\\'s betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. It\\'s kind of incredible that they wouldn\\'t hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of silent player Raymond Hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes at the end. As the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she\\'s doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and \"\"fans\"\" it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed my head off. The expression on his face! From that moment I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.\"\\n736,\"Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I\\'m one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I\\'ll not recommend this one to anyone.\"\\n737,\"Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word \"\"f--k\"\" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.<br /><br />Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!\"\\n738,\"First, the CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. At the end when the owner of the park gets killed, it\\'s probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation.<br /><br />That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on that island in particular? Well, it wasn\\'t stated in the movie. And, why would the people keep coming into the cat\\'s area? Makes no sense.<br /><br />One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a \"\"B made for TV movie\"\" movie, the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.\"\\n739,\"I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme\\'s best works.<br /><br />Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.\"\\n740,\"What a waste of talent. A very poor, semi-coherent, script cripples this film. Rather unimaginative direction, too. Some VERY faint echoes of _Fargo_ here, but it just doesn\\'t come off.\"\\n741,\"Although it strays away from the book a little, you can\\'t help but love the atmospheric music and settings.<br /><br />The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine\\'s dress in the first ballroom scene.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.<br /><br />Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel.<br /><br />Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it\\'s hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.<br /><br />General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.<br /><br />I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.<br /><br />some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks \"\"I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?\"\" What a silly thing to say! Elinor\\'s calm response is stupid too.<br /><br />anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me\"\\n742,\"Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film, which should be titled A CONVENIENT LIE. The website address where his debunking report, which is titled \"\"A SKEPTIC\\'S GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH\"\" can be found at is :www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you read those demolitions, you\\'ll realize that alleged \"\"global warming\"\" is no more real or dangerous than the Y2K scare of 1999, which Gore also endorsed, as he did the pseudo-scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, which was based on a book written by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber. As James \"\"The Amazing\"\" Randi does to psychics, and Philip Klass does to UFOs, and Gerald Posner does to JFK conspir-idiocy theories, so does Mario Lewis does to Al Gore\\'s movie and the whole \"\"global warming\"\" scam.\"\\n743,\"A lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to China. Captures the amazement of film\\'s first audiences pretty much as it\\'s described to have been worldwide, and uses actual Lumiere films for most of the actualities. I don\\'t agree with other people about bad acting on the British fellow\\'s part - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese lead really stole the show. In any case, I found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie. People who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in English (which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the Chinese on the DVD).\"\\n744,\"Sigh. I\\'m baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. And we got the \"\"joke\"\" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?<br /><br />But I guess what\\'s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE, THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? \"\"Give your head a shake\"\" as Don Cherry might say.\"\\n745,\"Cute idea... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra. That country, which wasn\\'t even in North America, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) Linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although Yolande Donlan\\'s heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. There are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese vendor. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and \"\"the new princess\"\" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra\\'s financial problems worsen... Fun little farce....along the lines of Marx Brothers film. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! Guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the UK & the US.\"\\n746,\"Back in 1982 a little film called MAKING LOVE shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men.<br /><br />I have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is all that and more.<br /><br />Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, cliché-ridden, and quite corny. That is what makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />As to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection.<br /><br />I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day lives of the characters. If I could give it more than ten stars I would. Good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable.<br /><br />It\\'s about time!\"\\n747,\"The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn\\'t really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. It\\'s still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed. It all helps to make \"\"Dirty Work\"\" to be one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts.<br /><br />8/10\"\\n748,\"This movie came as a huge disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. Unfortunately, it didn\\'t. It added more plot holes than it resolved, and confused more than it clarified. The animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn\\'t even take place in dull WWII Earth rather than the Alchemy world), and disappointing ending (Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches Winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster. Do yourself a favor-- disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.\"\\n749,\"Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I\\'ve been feeling down in the dumps and it\\'s such a lovely little fairytale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I\\'ve been for a while.<br /><br />It is a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdom\\'s history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. That\\'s much of what makes it so good; it\\'s an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.<br /><br />I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.\"\\n750,\"I was surprised that \"\" Forgiving the Franklins \"\" did not generate more buzz at this years Sundance Film Festival. There were times that the laughter at the screening I saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. The movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues . You know little issues like Religion, sex and the truth. Lots of comedy\\'s seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations, many leave you thinking \"\" I know they ripped this off from some sitcom \"\" .This film takes off on its own unique direction . I really think that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film.\"\\n751,\"They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station. They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once they\\'re grown, it\\'s easy to spot the writer/director among the four. He\\'s the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only there\\'s no writing, or directing talent on display here. And if you still can\\'t figure out which one he is, here\\'s a hint: The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme. And if you don\\'t quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. It will clue you in and what you\\'re supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah, that\\'s the ticket. Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world can\\'t wait to see it onscreen? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.\"\\n752,\"I watched this movie so that you don\\'t have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? He did this for scale? <br /><br />At least the film\\'s title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn\\'t sure if Genevieve Bujold\\'s character really existed. This does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story!<br /><br />The \"\"making of\"\" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. It explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot.<br /><br />To it\\'s credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn\\'t in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1M. Too bad the money wasn\\'t spent on a better project.\"\\n753,\"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I\\'m so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.<br /><br />First of all \"\"The Messengers\"\" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie\\'s resolution.<br /><br />Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes.<br /><br />If you\\'ve seen previews for this movie, then you\\'ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.\"\\n754,\"I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina)... I just couldn\\'t watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed. I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don\\'t get how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and I just don\\'t think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. And that\\'s not a good enough reason, I think. There\\'s absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say \"\"Well, at least \\'x\\' thing about it was good\"\". But well, I guess I will never understand that kind of films.\"\\n755,\"A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he\\'s there. The Music. A disinterested look at the life of policemen. Minuses: The violence and the gore, but I guess they add to the realistic effects. Still, having people\\'s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.<br /><br />No complaints - 7/10\"\\n756,\"I don\\'t understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I cannot understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />Cartoon characters abound - Sue\\'s foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue\\'s Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I\\'ve no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do, why should I be expected to care what happens to them? So many reviews keep carping on about how \"\"realistic\"\" it is. If that is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.<br /><br />I didn\\'t like the film at all.\"\\n757,Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low. It is weird since Steven\\'s last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash. Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn\\'t even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway. As for the action well let\\'s just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn\\'t make scenes sometimes. flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time\\n758,\"A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer\\'s next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. \"\"Dressed To Kill\"\" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma\\'s own \"\"Carrie\"\"--not to mention \"\"Psycho\"\". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****\"\\n759,\"*Flat SPOILERS* <br /><br />Five med students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) & Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).<br /><br />Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, Joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the TV Screen, Rachel relives her father\\'s suicide and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions.<br /><br />Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a Gothic Med School, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin.<br /><br />The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in \\'Lost Boys\\', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.<br /><br />A must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the \\'80s that get respect even today, like the mention by Rebecca Gayheart in \\'Scream 2\\' or the Tru Calling episode which used the movie\\'s premise.<br /><br />Flatliners: 9/10.\"\\n760,\"One of my favorite shows back in the \\'70s. As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?) here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together.<br /><br />Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.<br /><br />I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which/who \\'came back\\' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the \\'power beast\\' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. Oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.<br /><br />McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.<br /><br />Definitely deserves a place in TV\\'s \"\"Hall of Fame\"\". To quote Tony Vincenzo .... \\'Kolchack you are ON IT \\'... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame,\\'IN it\\' !\"\\n761,\"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his \"\"wedding.\"\" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The \"\"joke\"\" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his \"\"bits and pieces.\"\" Problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking \"\"Do I look fat?\"\" I recognize the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God the show was short-lived.\"\\n762,\"Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time; and just at the moment you realize you shouldn\\'t be laughing, you\\'ve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness; and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide-open mouths and glazen eyes, you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and... well, you get the point.<br /><br />But for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face, Frownland, really is a remarkable piece of work that, after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps, makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time, you feel sickenly sorry for him.<br /><br />It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein\\'s film, but for some insane reason, I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer. If someone sets you on fire, you typically want to put it out: Stop! Drop! And Roll! But with this film, you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body. You endure the pain--perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity I can\\'t even begin to attempt to explain.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you. But if you get a chance to catch it, prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag.\"\\n763,\"I saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late-night 80\\'s sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning. I must say, I didn\\'t expect much, and I didn\\'t get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not Oscar-worthy, to say the least. This movie has its ups and downs, and does have a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was awful. Not even a typical slasher movie. No gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I\\'d give it a 3 out of 10.\"\\n764,\"I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called \"\"Laupta: The Flying Island\"\"). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the \"\"Streamline Dub\"\" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn\\'t have the same raw energy that the \"\"streamline\"\" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character\\'s name from \"\"Pazu\"\" to \"\"Patzu\"\", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney\\'s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.\"\\n765,\"This film can\\'t make up its mind whether its message is \"\"humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless\"\" or \"\"don\\'t ever go in the water again.\"\" A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (I doubt it was her first.) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos.<br /><br />The film reeks of half-thought out anti-human message, \"\"the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!\"\" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all. It\\'s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and, as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to the whale\\'s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better.<br /><br />The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melville\\'s eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident. It\\'s clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However, it never goes there. The whale-character has no compassion or respect for anyone.<br /><br />The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier.) I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this film\\'s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming.<br /><br />The only message one can walk away with is \"\"If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.\"\"\"\\n766,\"Why, o\\' WHY! ...did I pick this one up? Well... i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool.<br /><br />Of course I should\\'ve known better. This is a really, really bad movie. And it gets embarasing when the makers know it\\'s bad, and try cover it up by adding some sexy/beautiful women, and some sex-scenes to it. Well, folks... it does\\'nt cut it, does it!<br /><br />If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very, very good, well-played and funny: go rent Lake Placid! (that is an order)\"\\n767,\"Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine \"\"Seaview\"\" is what appear to be chunks of--rock? falling down through the water and crashing into its hull. But it\\'s not rock, they\\'re under the North Pole--it is ICE! Everybody, except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS.<br /><br />Then, disaster strikes--that darn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the Earth catches fire! No one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is utterly impossible for radiation to \"\"catch fire\"\", and even if it could, there is NO AIR IN SPACE for it to burn.<br /><br />There is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film; however, Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we are meant to focus on the \"\"people\"\" instead, which is pretty easy, as they are CARDBOARD.<br /><br />The cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his \"\"Lost in Space\"\" TV series, the concept of which was swiped outright from writer Ib Melchior and then rushed into production.<br /><br />The sub looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a \"\"2\"\".\"\\n768,\"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven\\'t seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don\\'t think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn\\'t see this movie, even though it\\'s PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don\\'t even remember what it was about, once was enough!\"\\n769,\"A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon\\'s seed. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it\\'s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to \"\"The End\"\"..\"\\n770,\"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining Scooby-Doo and company.<br /><br />Shaggy\\'s voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They\\'ve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure what they\\'re on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely isn\\'t following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.<br /><br />And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it\\'s not real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me; this might, too.<br /><br />It\\'s worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. Besides, I am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. We\\'ll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then I\\'ll have formed a much more solid opinion.\"\\n771,\"I often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them.<br /><br />With Aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. The script was non existent with inane dialogs such as \"\"Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai\"\" and \"\"Yeh Versace hai Madam\"\" (yeah right).<br /><br />Every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. Acting was awful. Constumes (lycra for Udita and awful suits for a stocky Emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish.<br /><br />For those people who love Hashmi and his movies, watch it. As for me, I\\'ll never get those two and a half hours back. The only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent.\"\\n772,This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this.\\n773,\"Even this early in his career, Capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing. This is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich \\'prince\\' will lose his fortune.<br /><br />Nonetheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it\\'s easy to get caught up in the clichés. Then the movie does become more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to compliment the title-writing: very witty and fun.\"\\n774,\"Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. Its as if he couldn\\'t be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. Additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, I\\'m guessing that Boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. It really stinks. Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he\\'s ever learned about film gets flushed. The last film he made that was this bad was Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films I\\'ve ever seen. This isn\\'t that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. I\\'d take a pass unless it\\'s late at night and you\\'re catching it on cable.\"\\n775,\"This video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything else<br /><br />by Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is). To be honest, I don\\'t think that I\\'ve ever<br /><br />laughed at something as much as this, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse. This show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with M) but it didn\\'t bother me. See it, the funniest thing I\\'ve ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too.\"\\n776,\"This film is dreadful. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. While there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laboured, hackneyed and ultimately, mindlessly boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer\\'s client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. Despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good..!)\"\\n777,\"It\\'s amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it\\'s impossible to care about any of them-- especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you\\'d be better off renting \"\"Singles,\"\" or \"\"Bodies, Rest & Motion.\"\"\"\\n778,\"I never watched the \\'Next Action Hero\\' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the \\'prize\\' from that competition. I was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end.<br /><br />Yes, the plot\\'s been done (The Most Dangerous Game, etc.) but I was hoping for, and almost received, the \\'gotcha\\' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. I think the high-tech was overdone (GPS\\'s) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of Night Rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone.<br /><br />The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up? Pleeease. Way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much.<br /><br />The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who doesn\\'t get near as much work as he deserves IMHO - they were winners from a reality show.<br /><br />Knock me out.\"\\n779,\"I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920\\'s to 1960\\'s period. I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it\\'s telling you something.....4 of 10. Also, Romero\\'s expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard (I don\\'t know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me), and that\\'s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. It\\'s shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it.\"\\n780,\"I just wanted to say that. I love Gheorghe Muresan, so I automatically loved this movie. Everything else about it was so-so... Billy Crystal is a good actor, even if he is annoying. But the thing that made this movie was- at least, for a basketball fan- seeing Gheorghe Muresan act.\"\\n781,\"I thought that this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn\\'t that much. The special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row. This movie just absolutely tops everything else I have ever seen. It was everything I would expect out of a movie. I just loved it. Also, it was pretty kid-friendly. This movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it, anything is possible. I would give it a pure 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Absolutely amazing. Loved it.\"\\n782,\"This is a funny film and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tee. This is, of course, the usual good vs evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part, but still works well. A comedy for a night when you don\\'t want to have to think much, it\\'s well worth a rent!\"\\n783,\"Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partly right. For me, this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD! I have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, this isn\\'t even so Bad, its good. There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis\\' other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure Garbage. Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here. Actually, perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 Stars, seriously. Grade: F\"\\n784,\"First of all yes I\\'m white, so I try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race... anyway... White People Hating Black people = BAD but Black People Hating White people = OK (because apparently we deserved it!!). where do i start? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win!!! the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless... This is NOT a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it doesn\\'t deliver... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead...cmon simply awful I do regret ever seeing it.<br /><br />Save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written ,poorly acted, dull and clearly biased picture, if you are into the subject, go and Rent American History X, now thats a movie\"\\n785,\"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like \"\"The Flesh and the Fiends\"\" and \"\"From Beyond the Grave\"\", pairing up in a mid-70\\'s satanic themed exploitation flick. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can. To my deepest regret \"\"Land of the Minotaur\"\" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote little area in Greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. \"\"Land of the Minotaur\"\" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn\\'t bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.\"\\n786,\"The three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless Chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. Chaplin\\'s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done. The problem with this compilation is a minor one, yet annoying. The shorts have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s. This results is jerky motion that doesn\\'t look very attractive, and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it\\'s just not excusable that the current DVD version is unrestored, the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed. There are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but alas this has not been done.<br /><br />A minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article, but I say again a minor quibble, it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating. The shorts are still worth \\'10\\'.\"\\n787,\"1979\\'s Tourist Trap is a clever, unique B thriller that stands out as one of the best of it\\'s kind.<br /><br />Travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner\\'s mannequins are a little too life-like for comfort.<br /><br />While the film has hints of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tourist Trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of The Twilight Zone. Director David Schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, that reaches nightmarish proportions. Also, Schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings.<br /><br />Venteran actor Chuck Connors is the best of the film\\'s decent cast. Pino Donaggio\\'s music score is excellent, having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie. A number of the film\\'s sequences are quite memorable.<br /><br />For horror and thriller fans alike, Tourist Trap is an unforgettable must-see film.<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****\"\\n788,\"Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2...... I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG!, I wish I\\'d stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino\\'s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the \\'goodies\\' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn\\'t ready for an emergency?)... NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again. But I\\'ll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years.\"\\n789,\"This little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it looks. It has so many layers. I\\'ve watched it over and over, and always pick up on something new. I am amazed at the depth of the acting, and I feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that Alan Rickman is a major star\"\\n790,\"UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based. The key word here is \"\"based\"\". How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom.<br /><br />Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It. This involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney\\'s misadventures. The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer. This contradiction is never that much of an issue, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects likability too well.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney\\'s editor a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidney\\'s affections And, with regard to Megan Fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), I can say only this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort. Of course, given that I\\'m a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you might not find my offer too enticing, but it\\'s there on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far, one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become: however, she does it sweetly, with some skill, and extremely sexily. This girl will go far.<br /><br />There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US.<br /><br />There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and I smiled most of the way through. As ever, the F-word makes appearances when it really doesn\\'t need to, although at least a couple of these are very funny.\"\\n791,\"Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with of all things On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. <br /><br />Derivative doesn\\'t even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him\\x85. he turns her down. AGGH!) <br /><br />In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke.<br /><br />With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /><br />I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame, Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan\\'s Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.<br /><br />That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.<br /><br />Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie.\"\\n792,\"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. \"\"You Are Alone\"\" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!! It was compelling and riveting.<br /><br />I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed. I admired Brittany\\'s strength (what a strong woman).<br /><br />The tag line is \"\"When your darkest moments come to life\"\". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says oh I would never do that, when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject. The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part.<br /><br />Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!\"\\n793,\"I love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. Not just because I\\'m a huge Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, especially Linnea\\'s scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed.<br /><br />Plenty of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...By the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the Unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing.\"\\n794,\"i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled \"\"sholay\"\". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan\\'s acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this film don\\'t deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop. <br /><br />\"\"FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS\"\"\"\\n795,\"Lorna Green(Janine Reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. It\\'s quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. After the murders within her fantasies are committed, Lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.<br /><br />If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco, I\\'d say it\\'s elegant & difficult. By now, you\\'ve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. And, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. I\\'ll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even Franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched \"\"Succubus\"\", admitted that he didn\\'t even understand the film and he directed it! Some might say that \"\"Succubus\"\" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, \"\"Venus in Furs\"\", considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn\\'t truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. In a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, \"\"Succubus\"\" is unconventional film-making where we aren\\'t given the keys to what is exactly going on. And, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn\\'t help matters. \"\"Succubus\"\" is also populated by beatnik types and \"\"poet-speak\"\", Corman\\'s film, \"\"A Bucket of Blood\"\" poked fun at. My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. Great locations and jazz score..I liked this film myself, although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.\"\\n796,\"This outing of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, Frank Welker. Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. Knotts works for a small \"\"no where\"\" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong the city fathers, allow Knotts to take the fall. Frank Welker\\'s character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and Knott\\'s good name. This film shows the usual Knott\\'s scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. This may have been Knotts\\' last good outing. When you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, Don Knotts.\"\\n797,\"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn\\'t know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who\\'s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.\"\\n798,\"Why do I hate this? Let me list the ways:<br /><br />I have nothing against Mary Pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid.<br /><br />There\\'s a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it\\'s considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes <br /><br />Strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt<br /><br />The title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs<br /><br />For a \"\"family\"\" film the fights were WAY too violent (loved it when Pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /><br />Seriously, 40 minutes in I gave up and turned it off. The slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. Also there was no plot that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haines who was a top leading man in the silent era.<br /><br />Just painful. Avoid.\"\\n799,\"Thank God this wasn\\'t based on a true story, because what a story it is. Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren\\'t carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn\\'t hurt either.<br /><br />The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents\\' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: \"\"Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery\"\", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn\\'t like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn\\'t make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you\\'ve got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands. Proceed with caution.\"\\n800,\"If you want just about everything you want to know about WWII from multiple perspectives, this DVD delivers, you WILL learn new things guaranteed, so much so that you won\\'t need any other documentary\\'s on the subject.

As a bonus, watch this with Tora tora tora, saving private ryan, patton, band of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day and other WWII epics along with this to make your knowledge of WWII even more complete. Sir Laurence Oliver\\'s voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series. Seriously you won\\'t find a better WWII documentary set on the subject. PERFECT 10!!!\"\\n801,\"The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning. We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment. <br /><br />The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn\\'t there. Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities.<br /><br />There are many fine supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney.<br /><br />I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD. The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Don\\'t miss this brilliant movie. To me, this is what great film-making is all about.\"\\n802,\"This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan... Daly, this show does not seem to have any of these.<br /><br />I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I am going to stick to it. Though it\\'s too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. I hope that this show will last long!<br /><br />Returning back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O\\'Brien, for example (I know it\\'s a cardinal sin to be repelled by O\\'Brien\\'s antics; but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). <br /><br />I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen\\'s spoof of Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. Idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people\\'s pictures, and (if I am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting \"\"Gary Coleman\"\".<br /><br />Added on 16th April, 2007: Coming back once again, I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was funny as hell.<br /><br />I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, I would better write down my suggestion here for him: I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of late night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike\\'s talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of SNL, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA).<br /><br />God willing!<br /><br />Returning back on 14th July, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike\\'s talkshow must be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.\"\\n803,\"It\\'s all about getting what you want when you want it. And the message of Bluebeard\\'s Eighth WIfe is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.<br /><br />Most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn\\'t relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. Misogynistic pirates aside, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn\\'t what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.<br /><br />The film has definite French sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you\\'re not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason I watched the film was because they are \"\"likable\"\" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they\\'re unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. <br /><br />If you can accept it on its own terms you\\'ll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it\\'s all about. Such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.\"\\n804,\"Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I\\'m appalled. For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i\\'m afraid i don\\'t know what the world has come to. Let me tell u something. I started watching many T.V shows like Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood and even Invasion. But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. Then we have The Sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. There is no department that this show doesn\\'t excel in. Acting- Nothing short of superb. James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would\\'ve been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony. The raw emotion he displays is superb. Then we have everyone else, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese (whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2) and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie \\'Walnuts\\' Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform to the best quality, and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. Then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before. The story is nothing short of excellent. Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic. I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of. Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television, and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. Not just say its too violent, or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral, i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day, i don\\'t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God. I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you\\'ll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it. Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V. After you\\'ve watched the first season, you\\'ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.\"\\n805,\"I\\'d give this a negative rating if I could. I went into this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously,the worst thing I\\'ve ever seen. I wasn\\'t entertained, it wasn\\'t funny,I wasn\\'t even bored! I wasn\\'t anything. It wasn\\'t even so bad it was good, it\\'s just bad. Ridiculous actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Don\\'t even rent this movie. No clue how it\\'s getting such a high rating.\"\\n806,\"Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, which paid Judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks \"\"all faggy.\"\" Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like \"\"can we family style her\"\" and \"\"hey man, I\\'m \\'bating here!\"\" This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.\"\\n807,\"This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s\\' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid. It doesn\\'t help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometown\\'s graveyard when I was ten. Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but I love it now, as a 24 year old.<br /><br />I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. This movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one\\'s for you. 9/10!\"\\n808,\"While not quite as good as A Murder is Announced, which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I don\\'t take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace, and both of the above problems, and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations, worst being Sittaford Mystery, which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement, it not only respects the book, despite a few liberties, but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had. Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with nice photography and period detail, and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time around, and make the most of an in general well-done script, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple, and solid turns from Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox\"\\n809,\"Good Lord, what were they THINKING??!!!!!! Here is your spoiler warning, even though I don\\'t think it\\'ll really matter. You won\\'t be seeing this piece of trash anyway.<br /><br />A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid.<br /><br />You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots can\\'t save something!! And they didn\\'t! I know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign \"\"HIT\"\" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad.<br /><br />All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES.\"\\n810,\"I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One. (didn\\'t make it past the first six episodes) <br /><br />The writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. The dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.<br /><br />The characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes\\' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché, I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer\\'s loyalty.<br /><br />Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldn\\'t get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.<br /><br />Add to that I heard that Season Two wasn\\'t as good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.<br /><br />If you\\'re a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you\\'re stoned and then all bets are off.\"\\n811,\"This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. <br /><br />In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? <br /><br />Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.\"\\n812,\"As if the film were not of value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC; that fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film. And for better or worse--and I\\'ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades--Milo O\\'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.\"\\n813,\"This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution. It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love. <br /><br />The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film. DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people\\'s daily lives and pursuits. That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history.<br /><br />The excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could.<br /><br />The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /><br />The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending.\"\\n814,\"I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey \\'60s. It\\'s politics too upfront and ridiculous. And let\\'s face it, I was still under a love-spell known as BLOWUP : and I still haven\\'t completely shaken it. Now the \"\"love\"\" is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and, oh well . . . Good Luck to me!<br /><br />But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is it\\'s own \"\"experience\"\"and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator, the late,great Mr. Antonioni.<br /><br />Twelve years ago, I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print, projected at its correct size (immense), restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of \"\"place\"\".<br /><br />What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own.<br /><br />I remember the second time around seeing it --- the early 80s --- I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas, before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli\\'s Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet)they now were engaging me --- particularly The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She-took-her-time . . . To Live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her.<br /><br />Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found \"\"enjoyment\"\". The encroaching shoulder-padded, big haired 80s whispered \"\"But that\\'s a hippie fantasy --- let it go\"\"<br /><br />The force of Antonioni\\'s vision had, I had realised, already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered \"\"80s\"\" with an \"\"Uh-Huh\"\" and guarded my \"\"love\"\" secretly, possessively and jealously.<br /><br />But, this, then is what good art does it lives inside of you, and, if you wish it has its way and \"\"loves\"\" you back: secretly, jealously, and possessively. And you get \"\"changed\"\".<br /><br />Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment. But, hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all.<br /><br />Today reality hit, ZP has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of ALICE\\'S RESTAURANT.<br /><br />So, it is still too \"\"difficult\"\", too \"\"disturbing\"\", too \"\"what\"\"?<br /><br />Maybe it\\'s that, as with all good art, it Lives while everything dies around it. <br /><br />Peace.\"\\n815,\"Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she\\'s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It\\'s all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. Luckily enough, leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts. Yeah, right...\"\\n816,\"This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70\\'s starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn\\'t make the cut as a marine. Dressed in \\'baby blue\\' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine \\'Raider\\'. Gere\\'s character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent\\'s innocence, stealing his \\'baby blue\\' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincent\\'s character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere\\'s outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine \\'Raider\\'. Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine \\'Raider\\' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps, as the towns folks go \\'hunting\\' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there\\'s still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70\\'s performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70\\'s were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80\\'s with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as \\'Hedge\\', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he\\'s the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with JMV\\'s talent and his looks. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil, as explored in \"\"Buster and Billie\"\", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O\\'Connor is delightful as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada.\"\\n817,\"Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I\\'ve been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash\\'s narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we\\'ll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I\\'d love to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA\"\\n818,\"Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva\\'s most political movies. It takes stance strongly against modern day society\\'s authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society.<br /><br />Vatanen (Antti Litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern Finland - only to realize that the concept of a \\'free country\\' isn\\'t all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls.<br /><br />Still the thing that makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70\\'s, as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation. Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us Finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.\"\\n819,\"I love Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see.<br /><br />And I walked out of this one.<br /><br />Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (\"\"Oh no, Jamie\\'s knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!\"\"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.<br /><br />The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point, it\\'s just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you\\'ve heard before, and too many \"\"tough guy\"\" lines... and I don\\'t mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there\\'s a bit of originality to it. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he\\'s really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.\"\\n820,\"After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99$ bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try. I don\\'t think you will be disappointed. And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.\"\\n821,Send them to the freezer. This is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. The complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.\\n822,\"Wow! I picked this off the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in \\'Trainspotting.\\' This is a phenomenal movie; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. When I wasn\\'t laughing, I was at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a film I would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. This film has everything to keep ME happy!\"\\n823,\"I don\\'t know why some people criticise that show so much.<br /><br />It is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still...<br /><br />The family dynamics are funny, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing.<br /><br />This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 8/10\"\\n824,\"Mexican Werewolf in Texas is set in the small border town of Furlough where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) & she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town, killing livestock & several residents including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. Erm, I\\'m struggling now because not that much else actually happens...<br /><br />Written & directed by Scott Maginnis I won\\'t beat about the bush here & simply say that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is awful, period. The script only ever mentions the word Werewolf once & the rest of the time it\\'s referred to a Chupacabra, in fact I suspect this wasn\\'t really conceived as a Werewolf flick at all. The \\'Werewolf\\' creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog, there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesn\\'t change back into anyone either. To be honest apart from the title there\\'s nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip-off of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the type of home made crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980) which were all made on shoe string budgets, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999) but that\\'s it in recent years & crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. The character\\'s are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, I\\'m sorry but I don\\'t know how else to describe it.<br /><br />Director Maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there\\'s the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick \\'blink & you\\'ll miss something\\' editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure. It\\'s not scary, there\\'s no nudity, there\\'s no tension or atmosphere & the special effects are awful. The monster really does look poor & it\\'s no wonder Maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it. There\\'s virtually no colour to the picture either, it\\'s either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well. The gore consists of some fake guts (blink & you\\'ll miss them!), a few bloody wounds & a severed arm, big deal.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $300,000 I admit the budget was low but I simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film, there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far. The whole thing has the look of a home movie, it has no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at. The acting sucks too although you probably already knew that.<br /><br />Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think it\\'s a sequel to John Landis\\' classic which it most certainly isn\\'t & it isn\\'t even a proper Werewolf flick either. Don\\'t be fooled this is awful & I\\'m fed up of having to waste time/money on home made amateur crap like this.\"\\n825,\"I found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950\\'s culture-clash movie. John Wayne would hardly be one\\'s first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harrods. But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. The Duke was a guy who really could act well. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.<br /><br />Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. Many of his good intentions came a cropper. He had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.<br /><br />The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. I cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. There was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. The set pieces were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought had been applied to it.<br /><br />The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. Script was good without being too wordy. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn\\'t interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. Whether or not they were Japanese, I couldn\\'t say. But anyway they looked the part. At least the leads were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians, unlike other efforts such as \\'Blood Alley\\' (yes, I know they were Chinese) \\'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness\\' or even \\'The King And I\\'.<br /><br />Frankly, I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. The script was better for a start. I never liked the songs in \\'The King And I\\', and wasn\\'t impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of \\'Blood Alley\\'. I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke\\'s more popular outings.<br /><br />Recommended.\"\\n826,\"I was so glad I came across this short film. I\\'m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.<br /><br />It\\'s a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. And the last shot of the film is perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.\"\\n827,\"I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one, but when i started with it i found it really awful. They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in India. you can see Indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an Indian water brand), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don\\'t watch this waste of time\"\\n828,\"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. And i can count the films I have switched off before the end on one hand.<br /><br />The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what \"\"characters\"\" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless.<br /><br />The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, \"\"you aren\\'t going to shoot me\"\" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.<br /><br />The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.<br /><br />Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke\\'s? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /><br />In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film.\"\\n829,\"In this movie, Chávez supporters (either venezuelan and not-venezuelan) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /><br />They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement firing a lot of PDVSA best workers just for political issues.<br /><br />They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez during only 3 days in \"\"CADENA NACIONAL\"\" (a kind of confiscation o private TV signals). Each one with about 20 minutes of duration.<br /><br />They did not tell us anything about The quiting announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, Inspector General of the army forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, in despite of his announcement, he is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After Chávez return he occuped the Charge of Ministro del Defensa (equals to Defense Secretary in US).<br /><br />They did not say anything about Chávez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections.<br /><br />They did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by Chávez Supporters (either civilians and Military official forces).<br /><br />They present some facts in a wrong order, in order to lie.<br /><br />They did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and Chávez actions in order to avoid the elections.<br /><br />That\\'s why i tell you.... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.\"\\n830,\"One could wish that an idea as good as the \"\"invisible man\"\" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50\\'s. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we\\'re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.<br /><br />There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it\\'s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol\\' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, \"\"Hollow Man\"\" is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.<br /><br />However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go \"\"Oh darn!\"\" and \"\"Oh my God\"\". \"\"Hollow Man\"\" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I\\'m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.\"\\n831,\"OK, so it owes Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion has it\\'s own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. Thomas Jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart likewise. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-\"\"they got the Wong house\"\". The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is Mickey Rourke\\'s cameo appearance-\"\"take a peak\"\".<br /><br />Great Hollywood popcorn B-production with strong performances of A-level aspirants and renegades(Rourke).<br /><br />Well, take a peak, it\\'s worth.\"\\n832,\"As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal, I\\'d agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body part helping him. Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and hold things with it. He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. Also starring Home Alone 2\\'s Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain\\'s Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World\\'s Greatest Actor, and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Outstanding!\"\\n833,\"All I ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. All the while watching I was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn\\'t. I\\'ll admit to not finishing the film, I had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and I quote, \"\"More tail than any man in the past time.\"\" I know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. This film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead it exemplifies what America ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and I\\'m not against lesbians. Thank you Mr. Director! Someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait I have it! There\\'s no sequel!\"\\n834,\"I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O\\'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.\"\\n835,\"The story has been told before. A deadly disease is spreading around... But the extra in this film is Peter Weller, his interpretation of Muller on the run is real. He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child. This person could be working next to you.\"\\n836,\"This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it wasnt the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead!!!\"\\n837,\"As far as I know this was my first experience with Icelandic movies. It\\'s such a relief to see something else than your regular Hollywood motion picture. Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people watch this by accident, by recommendation or other...<br /><br />Because it\\'s really worth while. I left the cinema feeling really sad. I couldn\\'t get the tragic destiny\\'s of the characters out of my head. And it impressed me even more when I thought of the complexity of the film. Not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, watch it! It\\'s really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot.<br /><br />\"\\n838,\"Very typical Almodóvar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. And why is that? There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and I guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. No, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: The characters\\' nearly complete lack of taboo. It\\'s the same kind of \\'comic suspense\\' you find in his later works, though you\\'ll find it in a more rough version here. He\\'s building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.<br /><br />The sole reviewer who commented on this movie before I did, claimed that it had to be a \"\"very select\"\" group of people who\\'d find this movie hilarious. I do.\"\\n839,\"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (\"\"You\\'re just making it up as you go along!\"\" \"\"Yup, but I do it brilliantly\"\"), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of \"\"get on with it\"\". So, chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you go \"\"eek\"\".<br /><br />In terms of character development, this is clearly the clincher for Noel Clarke\\'s Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the Doctor\\'s companions, you know that he will do the right thing, and may even suspect the manner that he does it. However, it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path.<br /><br />While \"\"The rise of the Cybermen\"\" had more of the sinister build up to terror, \"\"The Age of Steel\"\" is an all out blast. Like \"\"Alien\"\" compared to \"\"Aliens\"\" - both true classics, but in different ways. Can the series keep it up at this level? Let\\'s hope so.\"\\n840,\"A Brother\\'s Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete\\'s life from a young age through full adulthood. The love and support of the family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. The commitment and determination of Dan\\'s coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.\"\\n841,\"Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his \"\"House of 1,000 Corpses\"\" crapfest, I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in \"\"The House of Seven Corpses,\"\" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don\\'t remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film\\'s only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like \"\"Satan\\'s School for Girls\"\" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with \"\"Children Shouldn\\'t Play With Dead Things\"\" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it\\'s nowhere near as entertaining or fun. \"\"The House of Seven Corpses\"\" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second...\"\\n842,\"Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces,like Network,Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.Now,Lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:Before the Devil Knows You\\'re Dead.I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet.This movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.Also,I think the ending of the movie is perfect.The performances are brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he\\'s,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but he\\'s underrated by my point of view.His performance in here is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great Albert Finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars.The film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.Before the Devil Knows You\\'re Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.We need more movies like this.\"\\n843,\"I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I don\\'t understand how the rating system works.??\"\\n844,\"I loved this film. I thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget. I ran out after watching this to buy the DVD, obv not easily forgotten!<br /><br />The script is brilliant, and the casting couldn\\'t be more perfect. Each character has their moment, and I laughed hard throughout this film, comedic timing was spot-on.<br /><br />\"\\n845,\"It\\'s not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it\\'s not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection.<br /><br />I can\\'t understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character\\'s actions: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly couldn\\'t tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. Why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean\\'s accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a rumpled, weary, \"\"take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in\"\" sort of way.<br /><br />Judas Kiss isn\\'t a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don\\'t recommend it unless you\\'re trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.\"\\n846,\"First of all, I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist \"\"East meets West\"\" cliché that bothers many Turks like myself. Okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds. However, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as \"\"east\"\" from the eyes of the \"\"west\"\". I mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of \"\"western\"\" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and \"\"keep the cash flowing\"\"? <br /><br />Why don\\'t you think about that?\"\\n847,\"STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest, so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn\\'t gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I can\\'t really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film.\"\\n848,\"First off, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, its just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I\\'ve seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.<br /><br />Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10<br /><br />I don\\'t drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie\"\\n849,\"i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie, but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie. the character of gust,played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed,yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive, and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie. it takes no time to understand what is going on, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine, human emotion. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn\\'t know it at all! i give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see \"\"r\"\" rated movies, make it a priority.\"\\n850,\"I must have seen this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw it in B & W on the local PBS station.<br /><br />I bought a DVD set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. They don\\'t teach history in School, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th Century. It expands their critical thinking.<br /><br />Impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.<br /><br />Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cooke\\'s America. Watch it with them, and make them understand. You\\'ll be so glad you did.\"\\n851,\"Steven Seagal\\'s films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. The film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. Most of the blame must lie at the director\\'s feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but Seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I haven\\'t even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for Seagal fans. Give it a wide berth!\"\\n852,\"and I for one think that is a good thing. I\\'ve just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this.<br /><br />As for the rest of the production, I think it was slightly less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out \"\"HEY! It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!\"\" and although I missed it, I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy.<br /><br />I also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage, it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre, not just at the movies.<br /><br />I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song \"\"Let me entertain you\"\", which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it.\"\\n853,\"So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember being Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. I especially liked the protesters tangent. It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it. If you get the chance to see this, take it. It is well worth the 30 minutes.\"\\n854,\"Thank God I watched this at a friend\\'s place and did not pay for it. The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out. You will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /><br />Also, actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh displays the worst acting I have ever seen, excluding porn. She\\'s lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He\\'s the one that carries the movie. <br /><br />I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! It\\'s a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.\"\\n855,\"A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from the director at a festival, I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie.<br /><br />The standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny.<br /><br />I\\'m giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared, and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.\"\\n856,\"Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction... all good films. Great films. But nothing, and I mean nothing lives up to the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus.<br /><br />The film is so great and has so many messages, I cried while watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sorrow, and then we wonder... what is so bad about this ice cream? Is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil? Think movie makes you think.<br /><br />This movie has the best rendition of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams, and we wonder; is the Santa we believe in really that good? Also, this Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas.<br /><br />You owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7. Whether it\\'s Christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. Whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.\"\\n857,I really cant think of anything good to say about this film...not a single thing. The script is a nightmare.. the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference. You\\'d think they would at least get a technical advisor. The performances were bad by most of the cast... although I dont really blame them.. the material really stinks. The editing was equally bad.. I\\'ll just stop now.. its all bad 2/10\\n858,\"Cinema\\'s greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy\\'s Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France\\'s New Wavers caught everyone\\'s attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti\\'s particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He\\'s not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. \"\"Incidents\"\" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.<br /><br />We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century\\'s great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler\\'s 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler\\'s ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it\\'s a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn\\'t get better than this. I\\'ll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it\\'s too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach\\'s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie\\'s thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it\\'s mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde\\'s jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde\\'s dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It\\'s ostensibly in English, but the DVD\\'s sound seems muddy and there\\'s a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />\"\\n859,\"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.<br /><br />The fights are not of high standards. They are way too \"\"simple\"\" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success. And after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. Think about the Rocky movies and you\\'ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. The fights are also shot poorly.<br /><br />There final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment.<br /><br />These guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn\\'t up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don\\'t know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.\"\\n860,\"This production was quite a surprise for me. I absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but I wasn\\'t prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by any chance, you\\'re not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. Of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT\\'S PAW is not available on video/DVD yet. Watch your PBS listings!\"\\n861,\"It isn\\'t TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.<br /><br />The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn\\'t be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it\\'s supposed to look like a home video) and it\\'s just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it\\'s stupid.<br /><br />It\\'s too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no \"\"Look at me Kimmy!\"\" jokes. The fat friend of Kim is not fat at all and she\\'s not even slightly stupid. She\\'s a stereotypical black/Latino chick.<br /><br />It\\'s just not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It doesn\\'t compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, this show is pretty funny at times, but it is NOT anything like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American take on a bogan family. They failed. It\\'s supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors don\\'t act stupid! To me, this is just a typical American TV show. It\\'s a let down if you want it to be anything like the Aussie show.<br /><br />2 Stars because it is an OKAY show, just nothing like what it should be.\"\\n862,\"From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated \\'Hillybilly Horror\\' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, the one \\'freak\\' who\\'s good at heart, etcetera...), but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. This is forgettable dreck, but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called \"\"Films that Suck\"\" earlier in his career, quite an ironic omen indeed.<br /><br />My Grade: D-\"\\n863,\"As a huge baseball fan, my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears. Dennis Quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher. It is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much \"\"Disney\"\" for my taste.\"\\n864,\"This film takes you on one family\\'s impossible journey, and makes you feel every step of their odyssey. Beautifully acted and photographed, heartbreakingly real. Its last line, with its wistful hope, is one of the more powerful in memory.\"\\n865,\"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore. How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. I can\\'t understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I\\'d get fired and I own the company.....I would have to fire myself. GOD! This movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of POO, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.\"\\n866,\"This show is great for many reasons..The father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age. Its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family. I watched this one time and became hooked.It so great to see a black family on TV worth watching. This show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates,death etc .The best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way. Great show for the family ..I cant tell you how many times I have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off. Great pg 13 rated show.I loved everybit of this show.\"\\n867,\"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind \"\"Batman Forever\"\" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.<br /><br />Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how \"\"Batman Returns\"\" can be considered at all disappointing.<br /><br />True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in \"\"Batman,\"\" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.<br /><br />Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier\\'s \"\"Richard III\"\"), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.<br /><br />There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn\\'t enough time to properly explore what\\'s going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.\"\\n868,\"The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.<br /><br />Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn\\'t a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.<br /><br />What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. It looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... \"\"you know, they have movies where characters do THIS! Does it fit here? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies so I should do it here!\"\" <br /><br />Maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). Otherwise, a must-miss.\"\\n869,\"I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn\\'t even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.<br /><br />For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders\\' typical meandering hero\\'s stream of consciousness, so it doesn\\'t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.<br /><br />But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.<br /><br />\"\\n870,\"Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their faces. A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior cops, SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn\\'t it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she\\'d stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.<br /><br />I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! The horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary I\\'m afraid) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible. Now that was a bright idea eh? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.<br /><br />I have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie\\'s lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended!\"\\n871,\"The one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies. hail and kill!\"\\n872,\"This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I\\'ve seen in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas Rope took place all in one room. I didn\\'t enjoy this one as much as Rope but that\\'s not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.<br /><br />It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.<br /><br />The film doesn\\'t feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.<br /><br />The performances are there, but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.<br /><br />In the end, I wanted more from this one. I understand it\\'s one of Hitchcock\\'s least exciting films, but I did have a good time watching it. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.\"\\n873,\"It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. I read the book before, and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book haven\\'t been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sue\\'s point of view then from Maud\\'s one. The main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.<br /><br />For each of her books the author, Sarah Waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.\"\\n874,\"This is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire B movies. <br /><br />Calvin Klein underwear model...oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of Vampiric Royalty, but Manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother Radu has other plans. Having killed their father the Vampire King, Radu now sets his sights on Stefan, Stefan\\'s new mortal girlfriend Michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful Bloodstone.<br /><br />Okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in Transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. The actresses are no great shakes and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? There\\'s only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is RADU! He\\'s a physical homage to Nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. I found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. But maybe I\\'m just a sicko. Questionable taste in men aside, I highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. It\\'s original, it\\'s fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I\\'ve seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining Undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He\\'s what a vampire should be.\"\\n875,\"Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghosts, and I do indeed know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.<br /><br />What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this. People forget there is more than one \"\"Bible\"\", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. <br /><br />Religion does not make everything fact, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is OK, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, \"\"Oh that was the Old testament, and now we have the New Testament.\"\" If the Bible is the word of God, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, \"\"Is no other way.\"\" The excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher. <br /><br />But anyhow, onto the review. I am a decent fan of \"\"Ghost Hunters\"\" and when I heard this show was coming soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like watching \"\"Ghost Hunters\"\", I do not like some of their members, and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. I am glad they are skeptical, but it\\'s like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. It\\'s more of a \"\"right place at the right time\"\" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it\\'s going to \"\"perform\"\" for you? This show is kind of silly. It\\'s usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. The main guy\\'s filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.<br /><br />Also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this show, but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed.\"\\n876,\"For a long time, \\'The Menagerie\\' was my favorite \\'Star Trek\\' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by \\'City on the Edge of Forever.\\' What I used to prefer about \\'Menagerie\\' was that it\\'s more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline. I still think it\\'s fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Though the \\'new\\' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For instance, given the Talosians\\' mind-control abilities and Captain Pike\\'s condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy ST\\'s only two-parter.\"\\n877,\"Coen Brothers-wannabe from writer-director Paul Chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching. Robert Forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating). An admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and Forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more. Veteran movie-director Irvin Kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). *1/2 from ****\"\\n878,\"When it was released this film caused a sensation. I watched it and was thrilled. Beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director Hamiltons photography. His photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some Vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. Actually nothing happens. It is like Hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. And this gets so boring after a while. I even didn\\'t watch the whole thing the second time, for I fell vast asleep. That is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it!<br /><br />Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10\"\\n879,\"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren\\'s missing sister.<br /><br />Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona\\'s \"\"Guyana - Crime of the Century\"\". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. With sister in toe, Kerman & Agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the \"\"Green Inferno\"\", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.<br /><br />One in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. This inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.<br /><br />Was it the so called \"\"Amazonian natives\"\" who looked like they were Bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in Sri Lanka), or the inept \"\"decapitation\"\" and \"\"castration\"\" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in \"\"Cannibal Holocaust\"\"? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though Lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. Most unsatisfying.<br /><br />As with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.<br /><br />If there are any redeemable features at all, Kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.\"\\n880,\"Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. This film is so bad it makes the Austin Powers films look Shakespearean. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this film? She\\'s a good actress but is just plain terrible.<br /><br />The writing is pathetically lame. There is not one funny, clever, or witty line. There is not one good sight gag.<br /><br />The directing is terrible. Comedy relies on timing. Someone should tell the director that. Every line that is supposed to be funny (and isn\\'t) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing I\\'ve ever seen.<br /><br />0 stars\"\\n881,\"Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well established \\'hero\\' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story don\\'t work and i felt its not Agatha\\'s mistake. The cast isn\\'t good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! The \\'victim\\' is not likable.\"\\n882,How can so many blundering decisions can be made.

And thats compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world.<br /><br />I should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be out of screen. I didn\\'t think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age, i was wrong. While typing this message, I\\'ve thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke present at Xmas.

His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America\\'s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. I\\'ve seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut\\'s genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best I\\'ve seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut\\'s \"\"voice\"\" out of the movie\\'s narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story\\'s fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.\"\\n885,\"This is one of the worst movies, I\\'ve ever seen. Not only, that it is a comedy, which isn\\'t funny, but it\\'s also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects.<br /><br />The two \"\"heroes\"\" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to German history and to show sensitive aspects of the \"\"heroes\"\", which finds its climax in showing how Erkan and Stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their \"\"joyful\"\" lifestyle (!). But I hadn\\'t expect anything better by director Michael \"\"Bully\"\" Herbig, who also made two not funny TV-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny SF-comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. For me the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.\"\\n886,\"I sat through this on TV hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear Gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40\\'s...\"\\n887,\"A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think that the difference didn\\'t matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it\\'s less clear why hers would be attracted to his.<br /><br />Still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him across the cat\\'s head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. It\\'s a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building, and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee.\"\\n888,\"Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. A must see for those who care about their families.\"\\n889,\"The only conceivable flaw of this film is it\\'s title!! Please stop comparing it to the first! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. If you haven\\'t seen the movie and are curious, TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this. There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it\\'s like a bad relationship I can\\'t get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind \\'The Stunt Man.\\'<br /><br />Robert Stack- WE LOVE YOU!!! (1919-2003)\"\\n890,\"Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn\\'t even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on.<br /><br />He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show\\'s producer, can\\'t escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.<br /><br />Jordi Molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.<br /><br />The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.\"\\n891,\"These kinda movies just don\\'t get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (Stand By Me being 1st.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and I think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did Sean Astin. I just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The script, the acting, the screenplay. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn\\'t in the room I would have absolutely balled whenever Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not see that coming!! At all!! I was real surprised when I heard that it wasn\\'t real popular back in the 90\\'s. I was born a few years after it came out so, of course, I didn\\'t go see it in the theaters, but im sure I would have if I would have been alive. If any of my friends watched this, they would be like, \"\"uhh okay?\"\" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven\\'t seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.\"\\n892,\"As a big-time Prince fan of the last three to four years, I really can\\'t believe I\\'ve only just got round to watching \"\"Purple Rain\"\". The brand new 2-disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching it, but I wasn\\'t prepared for just how electric it actually is. Prince\\'s musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he REALLY has the moves in this one. I am very familiar (from repeated listens) with the classic \"\"Purple Rain\"\" album and all its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself. There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform. The closing songs BABY I\\'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince was brimming with in his mid-20s (he\\'s overflowing!), it blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years.<br /><br />Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake, make her jump in, then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film\\'s overall charm. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group The Time perform THE BIRD you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the stage Minneapolis funk style - I love their dancing in this bit, and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror mid-performance.<br /><br />I already can\\'t wait to watch it again, I really can\\'t! Extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills Cop admit he is a \"\"Prince groupie\"\".\"\\n893,\"A good ol\\' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to \"\"plot\"\" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. The pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. Big John is big, but he isn\\'t convincing with the \"\"bad\"\" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a hoot as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no STORY. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. Perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know the one; it was made famous by... Jimmy Dean.\"\\n894,\"After several extremely well ratings to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon.<br /><br />I had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover\\'s caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. Brian, I am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club.<br /><br />Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /><br />Overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it were longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.\"\\n895,\"But it is kinda hilarious, at least if you grew up on Weird Al, like I did. It\\'s a mockumentary about his life and career, beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins. It\\'s uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when he goes to Japan. Although it\\'s not quite as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he doesn\\'t find love however fleeting, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo street life.<br /><br />Perhaps Weird Al isn\\'t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. Still, this is a funny movie.\"\\n896,\"One of the two Best Films of the year. A well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comedic role well (Though much like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.), and I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something I haven\\'t done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. John woo\\'s Hardboiled. Sure the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. Highly enjoyable.\"\\n897,I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong imagery. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. This leans towards the Gothic feel. I would love to see this as a full feature film. -- Carrie\\n898,\"Why else would he do this to me?<br /><br />Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies.

Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. Unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief.

I have seen this film more that 20 times, To me this is a real desert island film, I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love, Jessica Tandy, and Hume Cronin, are simply wonderful,Also Beverly D\\'angelo, Beau Bridges come in at a close second, don\\'t get me wrong there are many more great performance\\'s in this film, and it is also the way it is written that made it for me, and I hope you, a film that you will want to see over and over, I think TV shows like \"\"Northen Exposure\"\", and now \"\"Earl\"\" owe a lot to this film. but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film.\"\\n901,it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing. The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go. You shouldn\\'t really decide to watch this based on my review or not.

Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too memorable.<br /><br />Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about.

The drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. Whether you\\'re watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won\\'t shut up, or a victim\\'s father responding to the criminal\\'s death threat with \"\"Care for some tea?\"\", none of it is believable. This quite comfortably fits into the \"\"wannabe movie\"\" category.<br /><br />You will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. It\\'s quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. It\\'s really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.<br /><br />However, if you\\'re able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.<br /><br />I voted 4/10.\"\\n904,\"Yes, this is one of THOSE movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.<br /><br />But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we didn\\'t get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often the \\'big one\\' isn\\'t shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. I surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.<br /><br />The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After figuring out that the rats couldn\\'t stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. If you\\'ve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you.

I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie. The Plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast couldn\\'t have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.\"\\n906,\"This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. The other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you\\'ve got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat.\"\\n907,\"Following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man\\'s legacy is exactly as such. In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Che\\x97struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isn\\'t just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet, as Che would go on to say himself\\x97such a struggle is best told exactly as that\\x97a struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Che\\'s life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.<br /><br />While the movie\\'s tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. This somewhat distant, cold approach to telling Che\\'s story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man\\x97if anything, the entirety of Che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man\\'s struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); Che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who \\x96arguably- conducted the whole thing.<br /><br />Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn\\'t feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. Here, the basic structure of Part One is echoed back\\x97there\\'s the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. Yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. This difference, in combination with the similarities to Part One, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.<br /><br />Indeed, everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenes\\x97the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements don\\'t necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. In fact, upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One, and title the review as a whole, yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.<br /><br />With that said, I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each part\\'s ability to do just that. With a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie\\'s characters without drawing attention to themselves, Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\"\\n908,\"Sometimes it\\'s hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. It was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.It was fun. M.Louis Jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest. Mr Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor.Mr James Robertson Justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. But it is Miss Peters who stays in the memory.Wilfully adolescent,illiterate,tough but vulnerable,wonderfully agile,and ultimately,courageous,she is everybody\\'s idea of a lady pirate. There was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret.\"\\n909,\"I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes up until two years ago, when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, I instantly wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I must admit, it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film. At first the unpolished, raw and improvised way Cassavetes it was shot, put me off somewhat and I thought of it as an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment. But now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today.<br /><br />Shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family in which two of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against \\'seamless\\' Hollywood production values. Cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film was shot - were the Italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for Welles\\' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus ans Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything made before really. <br /><br />The song with the feathered girls, \"\"I feel like a lolly-pop\"\" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. But no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today. I think it\\'s this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims it was Jules Dassin\\'s THE NAKED CITY (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 8/10\"\\n910,\"Based on an actual story, John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss. A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get I.D. papers from the American embassy. To fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide. \"\"I tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself.\"\" <br /><br />Suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt. Just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot. In a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself. Continually her life was in danger. <br /><br />Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. This is an unforgettable story. <br /><br />\"\"We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps.\"\"\"\\n911,\"This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, \"\"Enough already!\"\" Of course, it isn\\'t nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don\\'s simulator. It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995.\"\\n912,\"SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO. (I\\'m leaning toward rip off.) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the \"\"Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks\"\" genre because it is actually shot in the South.<br /><br />A group of college girls head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (Note to Yankees: stay on the highway when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangle his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Note to Yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.<br /><br />While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I\\'ve seen since Walton Goggins (Deputy Steve Naish) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.<br /><br />A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.<br /><br />And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like he\\'s about to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he\\'s about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for this preacher\\'s flock. Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven.\"\\n913,\"Although this film has had a lot of praise, I personally found it boring. There are some nice Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one\\'s eyes open for.\"\\n914,\"No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for \"\"The House Next Door\"\" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. This Lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can\\'t find in this version we watched.<br /><br />The film\\'s star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />The film has a feeling of a cross between \"\"Desperate Houswives\"\" with \"\"The Stepford Wives\"\" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.\"\\n915,\"Meticulously constructed and perfectly played, To The Ends Of The Earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age.<br /><br />Based on William Golding\\'s trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey towards both Australia and experience of youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging man o\\' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a Government position Down Under.<br /><br />Among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous, bullying captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a canny 1st lieutenant who\\'s worked his way up from the bottom (Jamie Sives) and, fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes in the night.<br /><br />Quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time, crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />Shipboard life is one brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and as Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life\\'s hardships, Man\\'s inhumanities and his noblest sentiments.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World or Patrick O\\'Brian\\'s series of novels on which it was based will love this \\x96 for everyone else, it\\'s a whole new world to discover.\"\\n916,\"Wow. This is really not that good. <br /><br />I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good... it is, but it is nothing special.<br /><br />The movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies.<br /><br />*/****\"\\n917,\"I have to point out, before you read this review, that in no way, is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it, than hopefully you see, that I\\'m against politicians in general ... but if you\\'re looking to be offended ... I can\\'t help you!<br /><br />Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame, because the movie is great. Would it not be for \"\"Grbavica\"\", this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin.<br /><br />Rightfully so (it was the runner-up, or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It\\'s not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! <br /><br />Another reviewer had a great summary line: \"\"Comedy about a tragedy\"\", that sums it up pretty well!\"\\n918,\"I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it\\'s then that you know you aren\\'t simply watching another silly 80\\'s slasher with a pea brain plot. Thank god for that! Seriously, though, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it more than makes up for that with it\\'s originality. Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema, but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what I\\'d choose.<br /><br />Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it\\'s silly plot dug it into is the fact that it\\'s extremely entertaining. Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. This film, however, keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned), a constant stream of sick humour and a small, but impressive for the type of film, dose of suspense and tension. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. There\\'s nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough), but that\\'s not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows. There wasn\\'t any room for a chainsaw, which is a huge shame, but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it.\"\\n919,\"After many, many years I saw again this beautiful love story, thinking about how would I, half a century after, react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when I was just an male adolescent trying to understand women\\'s behaviors, in a small city in Brazil.<br /><br />This time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which the physician Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) makes clear to the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) her special ethically condition as an Eurasian. In fact, she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a \"\"occidental way\"\", provided that, by doing so, she is not betraying her Chinese side. Its seems to the spectator that Suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them.<br /><br />Therefore, Suyin\\'s attitudes always leave poor Elliott \\x96 a determined, brave and extremely practical man \\x96 anxious and perplexed, without knowing how much importance to give to her words. For him, whose love for her is plain and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together. \"\"Not so fast\"\", is what she seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time.<br /><br />In fact, Suyin\\'s Chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. And, as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself, she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant \"\"raids\"\" on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous is life, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of the English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings.<br /><br />In fact, it looks like a whole bunch of Chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people\\'s life totally miserable. Because of that, mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes, so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon; peasants are advised that they should shout loudly \"\"The rice is bad! The rice is bad!\"\" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the dead\\'s family be isolated from the other people by curtains, so that the gods don\\'t take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.<br /><br />In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone\\'s daily life.<br /><br />As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China really was, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that, launched by the USA after the first oil shock in 1973, took charge of the whole world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin\\'s Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today.<br /><br />A lot of History came into being since those old days. As to China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country finally reached, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as State capitalism. And, what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled Suyin in Hong Kong, in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned Elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It is gone, completely gone! In brief, if that story took place today, Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to one another, in their huge pragmatism, talking business as usual!\"\\n920,\"First and foremost I would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. Someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. When i watched it, I didn\\'t know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that I was clueless, and as I began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time i watched it, i was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their pureness as human beings, to their relationship. I watched it a second time, because i finally figured out how hypocritical I was being, saying to myself and others, \"\"Oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them\"\" while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story, because of my fear I suppose. The second time I watched this film, I opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that I\\'d heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings in love. And I loved it, i loved the storyline, i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film, i loved the sharing of feelings, and i loved the strong bonds created. It is a really eye opening, beautifully done film that made me cry at times, and I hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented in....\"\\n921,\"\"\"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\"\"! If IMDb would allow one-word reviews, that\\'s what mine would be. This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. The singing, the story, everything is dull and washed out--just like this public domain print. Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories (such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn\\'t age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! So my advice is DON\\'T watch this film. If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for A&C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.\"\\n922,\"Once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form. This is not it. This is an action movie that lacks convincing action. It stinks. Rent something else.\"\\n923,\"Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.<br /><br />The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.<br /><br />One important factor of Christy\\'s success is his mother\\'s support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christy\\'s dream come true. So lucky for Christy!And Hugh O\\'Conor is also excellent as young Christy, what a performance for a child! The love story of Christy is very well-done, trustful. Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series, the loathsome Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, I do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other.<br /><br />Btw, Jim Sheridan\\'s works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying\\', god knows why he chose to direct that crap! Really a career taint for him, what a pity!\"\\n924,\"I\\'m stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did. It\\'s an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliché\\' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of whom did a decent job), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels. I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, \"\"There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there\\'s nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. It\\'s possible to make a good film like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was amateur hour. There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one. Truly, another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films. Watch The Family Stone. It\\'s miles ahead of this schlock.\"\\n925,\"Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the one film missing from the list you\\'ve seen. One of 4 films Scott made at RKO during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into Trail Street, the town\\'s main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. It\\'ll take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. More I won\\'t say, except that Scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a Scott movie with confidence they\\'d learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many WORLD WAR II HEROS who starred in America\\'s movies. How sad what we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. I wonder how all this plays out in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.\"\\n926,\"I went to see this one with much expectation. Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to character\\'s behaviors. Today\\'s kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them \\'daydream\\' about the events. That\\'s precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers?) Seriously don\\'t waste your time & money on this one.\"\\n927,\"*Sigh* Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will get you only so far.<br /><br />To all you marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something.<br /><br />Lordi isn\\'t scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is OVER.<br /><br />I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Sure, they won the Eurovision.<br /><br />No, wait - they won the Eurovision. That\\'s it. I rest my case.\"\\n928,After the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. Yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are\\'nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as Dean Learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have\\'nt seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in All a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.\\n929,I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. I consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. <br /><br />The idiots that put it down on production value don\\'t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. And never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.<br /><br />I have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site I have found where it get mentioned.\\n930,\"I caught this on television one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970\\'s, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. It\\'s one of the best comedies of the 1970\\'s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary\\'s excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. This is the film that really got Ivan Reitman noticed as a director. Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it\\'s fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.\"\\n931,\"The film\\'s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (U.S.). We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. Befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. <br /><br />I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. It did not attempt to show how either was right, although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.<br /><br />Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you\\'ll find \"\"Higher Learning\"\" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10\"\\n932,\"Is rich, ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? Actually, both are applicable in director Joseph Losey\\'s wandering, meandering mess called \"\"Boom\"\", appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor\\'s mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai\\'s robe complete with saber. Though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz \\'n Dick-philes should shun (the stars\\' collective \"\"what the hell!\"\" attitude to their late-\\'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). Pointless, confused, and maddening, \"\"Boom\"\" is a catastrophe--although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play \"\"The Milk Train Doesn\\'t Stop Here Anymore\"\", was said to be quite fond of it! * from ****\"\\n933,\"i can\\'t even describe it. it\\'s the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen (i\\'m being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn\\'t-like-to-think-much.It\\'s not even scary. It\\'s revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...\"\"thing\"\" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.<br /><br />Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you\\'ll get \"\"The Nun\"\".<br /><br />And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!!\"\\n934,\"The screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (This film is confusing, because the audience doesn\\'t know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn\\'t great, but this is telly, so it was fine. I don\\'t mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />The prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed, it wasn\\'t clear what was happening, ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to \"\"Some riots are happening in Petersburg\"\", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution, so I could fill in the details, \"\"those pesky Communists\"\". The prologue is best ignored.<br /><br />This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) It sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, it\\'ll believe anything she says. Okay, a soppy romance. No, because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesn\\'t work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes, I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find rom-com romances more convincing, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they\\'ve even spent any time with each other.<br /><br />It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film.<br /><br />The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There\\'s a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a \\'One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Next/\\'Twelve Monkeys\\'-type informant. Thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story.\"\\n935,\"Lady and the tramp ii: scamp\\'s adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better. Lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original, but this time it\\'s junior\\'s turn, Lady and Tramp\\'s youngster (scamp) always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him, following the rules in the house, taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy, scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose. Scamp meets another dog called Angel, they both get along fine and do the things scamp\\'s mother and father did, having an italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc:)Afterwards, Scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal, which is the baby, scamp comes back and Angel is joined in the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.\"\\n936,\"Wow, what\\'s this on the video rental store\\'s shelf in front of me? Nothing other than a questionable \"\"sequel\"\" to 8MM. It wasn\\'t a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn\\'t like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise, its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn\\'t believe the words coming out of David\\'s mouth the whole time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the \"\"shocking\"\" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this \"\"hellish\"\" sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film. You could guess he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting \"\"respect.\"\" There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish\\'s father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn\\'t even about a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It\\'s one of Joel Schumacher\\'s better and more original films. It has everything better about it from this film. I wouldn\\'t recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.\"\\n937,\"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack\\'s performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny\\'s performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.\"\\n938,\"This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. But stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.<br /><br />First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. \"\"It\\'s funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;\"\" \"\"This door has serious damage to it that wasn\\'t here a minute ago;\"\" \"\"The door opened by itself, without me touching it;\"\" etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn\\'t she take some precaution before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the day time. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS!!! Also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE! The phone company doesn\\'t need to be involved. Walk up to the phone and unplug it. Case closed.<br /><br />Finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it\\'s alive was just comical. If the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could\\'ve done it in a way that didn\\'t look cartoony. Brave Little Toaster anyone?\"\\n939,\"The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker (Home Alone: Lost in New York, A Time to Kill), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show, Red Dawn), and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. However, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders (JFK, The Day After Tomorrow).<br /><br />The story is centralized around a foster child, up-and-coming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick, The Lookout). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. The two don\\'t have much, but what they do have: Angels\\' baseball, and what they are seeking: identity. That\\'s when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon, Predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager, George Knox. In relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are.<br /><br />Depressed over the fact that Roger (JGL) is separated from his father, he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant. Odds are astronomical, but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future, My Favorite Martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). Before you know it, Al (Lloyd) is sitting with Roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball\\'s biggest boners! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells\\' (DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear (nominated in Directors Guild of America). He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark, played by Tony Danza (4-time Golden Globe nominee, Emmy nominee), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim. Clark has been dubbed a wash-up, a once big-name in Cinci, but he has something to prove to Manager Knox.<br /><br />Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, We Are Marshall) for all you ladies out there?\"\\n940,\"I kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. When it ambiguously got there I was very disappointed. I\\'m going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I won\\'t. Maybe I\\'ll just imply something will happen. The writers lacked any imagination. This is not even a \"\"B\"\" movie - it\\'s a made for TV \"\"B\"\" movie.\"\\n941,The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. The parents are hilarious.They are caterers as well as enemies.The kids play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play.They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(Spoiler Ahead. I think) They sneak off after a party and do it. Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie. If you don\\'t like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don\\'t watch. If you don\\'t mind those you will have a blast watching this one.\\n942,\"If somebody wants to make a really, REALLY bad movie, \"\"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom\"\" really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness.<br /><br />Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white \"\"furry\"\" costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. Work your way slowly, painfully, through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the heck of it).<br /><br />On second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.\"\\n943,\"A film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />I saw \"\"Random Hearts\"\" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I\\'m sure this story will not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, especially considering the film\\'s darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (\"\"Star Wars,\"\" \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\"\" \"\"The Fugitive,\"\" \"\"Air Force One,\"\" \"\"Patriot Games\"\") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford\\'s very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (\"\"Forrest Gump,\"\" \"\"Back To The Future\"\") in his summer 2000 thriller, \"\"What Lies Beneath,\"\" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy\\'s \"\"The Sum Of All Fears.\"\" \\'Fears\\' will be Harrison Ford\\'s third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack (\"\"Out of Africa,\"\" \"\"The Firm,\"\" \"\"Tootsie\"\") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas\\' congresswoman. It\\'s a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see \"\"Eyes Wide Shut\"\" as well).<br /><br />Kristin Scott-Thomas (\"\"The English Patient,\"\" \"\"The Horse Whisperer\"\") shows that you don\\'t necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford\\'s quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford\\'s character\\'s investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by \"\"Heat\"\" actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch\\'s investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.<br /><br />The technical side of Pollack\\'s thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin\\'s (Pollack\\'s \"\"The Firm\"\") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (\"\"A River Runs Through It\"\") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film\\'s unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. \"\"Random Hearts\"\" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)\"\\n944,\"For all of the Has-Beens or Never Was\\'s or for the curious, this film is for you....Ever played a sport, or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left..this film explores that and more.<br /><br />Robin Williams(Jack Dundee) is a small town assistant banker in Taft CA., whose life has been plagued, by a miscue in a BIG rival high school football game 13 years ago, when he dropped the pass that would have won over Bakersfield, their Arch-Rival, that takes great pleasure in pounding the Taft Rockets, season after season . Kurt Russell(Reno Hightower) was the Quarterback in that famous game, and is the local legend, that now is a van repair specialist, whose life is fading into lethargy, like the town of Taft itself.<br /><br />Williams gets an idea to remake history, by replaying the GAME ! He meets with skeptical resistance, so he goes on a one man terror spree, and literally paints the town , orange, yellow and black , to raise the ire of the residents to recreate THE game . After succeeding, the players from that 1972 team reunite, and try to get in shape to practice, which is hysterical . The game is on , Bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets, game strategies, and sophisticated training routines . Taft is drawing plays in the mud, with sticks, stones, and bottle caps, what a riot ! Does Taft overcome the odds, does Robin Willians purge the demons from his bowels, does Kurt Russell rise from lethargy, watch \"\"The Best of Times\"\" for one of the BEST viewing experiences ever!<br /><br />One of Robin Williams best UNDERSTATED performances, the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic . And who is Kid Lester ???<br /><br />Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as the wives of Williams and Russell. Succeeds on Many Levels. A 10 !\"\\n945,\"This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria have done. <br /><br />It looks like a commercial from beginning to end. The ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod, it doesn\\'t have pace, rhythm. It\\'s illogical. what a mess. You can tell what\\'s gonna happen since the first 15 minutes, and the ending...Wow<br /><br />------spoiler-------<br /><br />Jesus Christ, how the hell Perrugorria got shot? Are you serious? Worst scene of someone getting shot ever!<br /><br />------end of spoiler-----<br /><br />Bad directing, bad script, bad acting...Really bad overall. I wouldn\\'t recommend this movie at all. It\\'s a waste of money and time.\"\\n946,\"I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90\\'s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.<br /><br />Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. Cops get lucky also. Capt Drebin (notice he\\'s a Captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of force, perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes.<br /><br />The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the sight gags,however. At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground, with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Python\\'s And Now For Something Completely Different.....<br /><br />If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3, or Top Secret, then you will definitely enjoy this. <br /><br />I always liked the series better than the movies, even though I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words : No O.J.\"\\n947,\"A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can\\'t be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. And IMO, it succeeds at being a nice film. It\\'s no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.<br /><br />7 out of 10 broken hearts\"\\n948,i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now WORD FOR WORD the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don\\'t say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment: this film is amazing love me xxx P.s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops.This film will go down in children\\'s film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children.\\n949,\"The film someone had to make.<br /><br />Waco: The Rules of Engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in Waco, Texas that led to the destruction of the Branch Davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. This is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner\\'s inquest.<br /><br />The second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it\\'s pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. If you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. If, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see \"\"Waco: The Big Lie\"\".<br /><br />In summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And it\\'s at times superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports.<br /><br />Perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the ATF raid or the psychological warfare tactics the FBI used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.\"\\n950,\"What a good movie! At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known Rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. And with a good sense of humour. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley\\'s Rock Around the Clock?<br /><br />Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n\\'roll I have ever seen. Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance. Why? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like anyone of us.<br /><br />Spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack! )and finally thinking of your own future.<br /><br />Bye!\"\\n951,\"Had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? You just want her gone from your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she\\'s in sick or well. But that in times, it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. That\\'s how Owen(Danny DeVito) had to deal with in \"\"Throw Momma Fron The Train\"\". His Momma(Anne Ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. He trying his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calls him a \"\"clumsy poop\"\", a \"\"larda$$\"\", and \"\"fat\"\" and \"\"stupid\"\". For his friend, Larry Donner(Billy Crystal) he has his own woman problems, his ex-wife. She trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does he do? Help return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it where Owen called Larry, \"\"Cousin Patty\"\". And Momma said, \"\"You don\\'t have a Cousin Patty!\"\" and Owen shouts \"\"You Lied To Me!\"\" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. That is thwarted, and she kicks Larry off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Momma kicked the bucket on her own. Maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. A fun movie it is, and the cast is great. A classic! 5 stars!\"\\n952,\"Yes, it is a bit cheesy. But it\\'s suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. It\\'s interesting to see David Soul in a \\'bad guy\\' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I\\'ve watched--movies or TV. <br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it\\'s difficult to fully enjoy it. This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn\\'t be universally sought after, but I\\'m sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version. I\\'ll keep hoping!\"\\n953,\"So it isn\\'t an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar<br /><br />(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. An<br /><br />imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well<br /><br />spent. For some reason, it hasn\\'t really caught on in the audience,<br /><br />something I do believe is a result of the main theme. Why did she<br /><br />commit suicide? Clearly, this is hardly something that US<br /><br />moviegoers will flock to, had it been an European production it<br /><br />probably would have reached its audience in a much greater<br /><br />extent. It is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by a<br /><br />shimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole hearted<br /><br />impression.\"\\n954,\"I absolutely loved this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the \"\"Two of Us\"\" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what \"\"might have been.\"\" Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances.\"\\n955,\"Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film\\'s plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.<br /><br />If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, I\\'d give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. If you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it\\'s a 10. I definitely think it\\'s a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75.\"\\n956,\"Great premise, poor execution. Cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly edited, waste of film. Only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food.<br /><br />Joan Chen, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick, and Alfre Woodard should fire their agents.\"\\n957,\"Have to agree that this movie and it\\'s talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here\\'s hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,\"\\n958,\"I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wasn\\'t disappointed. She looked gorgeous. Second of all, through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca\\'s films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. I kept watching until the end, but I got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.\"\\n959,\"This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat. Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap.\"\\n960,\"This was my first Gaspar Noe movie I\\'ve watched and I have to say I was shocked. I don\\'t mind gore in generally, but this isn\\'t even gore , it\\'s real butchering. For some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can\\'t stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I\\'ll let you figure them out. Don\\'t watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema.\"\\n961,\"I agree with BigAlC - this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the movie is greatly humorous and educational. I\\'m a big fan of Tom Selleck\\'s, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part, bringing the film to life in a way I can\\'t imagine any other actor being able to pull off. <br /><br />This film featured some first-rate Japanese actors, and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - Japan\\'s an awesome place to go, whether you want to party, sight-see or just try to take everything in.\"\\n962,\"I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. The entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome. I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives. The best part to this film (to me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. Namely, the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have a good laugh!\"\\n963,\"Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. <br /><br />Consequently I missed The Dismissal, along with many other Australian-made TV dramas of the \\'80s and \\'90s, such as the superb Janus and Phoenix series, which I have since seen, along with Wildside.<br /><br />To me the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I am aware, accurate. However, as to public \"\"outrage\"\" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. I know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. <br /><br />But the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. The inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /><br />This apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama.\"\\n964,\"I may be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. That mustache gets me riled up. I remember when I first saw a video of his. That girl he beat was amazing. The depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Mt. Rushmore. If I could ask him one question, it would be,\"\"If you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?\"\" Will Orhan be doing a reunion tour? Take note from the greats like Gordon Lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan For Life)\"\\n965,\"I never want to see this movie again!<br /><br />Not only is it dreadfully bad, but I can\\'t stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick.<br /><br />Mostly I can\\'t stand watching this terrible movie!<br /><br />Frankly, there is no reason to watch this awful film. The plot is just plain stupid. The actors that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! <br /><br />I warn you don\\'t watch it, the images will haunt you for a long while to come!\"\\n966,\"The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... The kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he \\'manages\\' to relate to the pygmies... No notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... I find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the \\'white mans\\' view\"\\n967,\"Life Begins - and ends - in a typical 1930\\'s maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shea, as they await to give birth. While the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace\\'s (Loretta Young) husband. What an actor! As a first time father, Jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. I felt his every concern keenly. I\\'d like to see more of this actor\\'s work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed \"\"Don\\'t cut! Don\\'t cut!\"\" as Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. Her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession.<br /><br />Loretta Young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as Grace. My, she is great in these precodes, I\\'ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months.<br /><br />Glenda Farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste (didn\\'t anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies\\' health?) but her character redeems herself in the end.<br /><br />Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, silent movie star, as a grieving Italian husband. His screen time was brief, but notable.<br /><br />Life Begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometime on TCM, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into. 9 out of 10.\"\\n968,\"This is a great film. Touching and strong. The direction is without question breathless. Good work to the team. I feel so sorry for Marlene, By the grace of God go you or I\"\\n969,\"I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians. A journalist like the main character ought to have known that. Thirdly, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!\"\\n970,\"*Criticism does mention spoilers*<br /><br />I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie\\'s character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse\\' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie\\'s character and Denzel Washington\\'s. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the murderer\\'s intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial \\'chess game\\' and gets with his pet project, Angelina.<br /><br />If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible \\'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you\\'d be bored.\"\\n971,\"Possible Spoilers, Perhaps. I must say that \"\"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\"\" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney\\'s sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as \"\"The Little Mermaid II,\"\" \"\"The Jungle Book II,\"\" and \"\"Peter Pan II,\"\" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made \"\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame II\"\" and \"\"Atlantis II,\"\" but I\\'m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.\"\") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney \"\"Cinderella.\"\" The sequel to \"\"Cinderella,\"\" however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, \"\"I\\'m going to do this banquet my way!\"\" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, \"\"Ewww!\"\" That is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original \"\"Cinderella\"\" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn\\'t seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good. One just can\\'t leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney\\'s name. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse.\"\\n972,\"Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of \"\"8\"\"s, this movie\\'s true score.<br /><br />As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Previous to going to see this movie I wasn\\'t that over the top about him but now I\\'m banging on the doors of Chris Rock\\'s website begging him to take me on as his protege. This film is truly funny, if you don\\'t find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it\\'s humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.<br /><br />There was one slight disappointment for me however. This was that in going into this film I didn\\'t realise that it was actually a remake of \"\"Heaven Can Wait\"\" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago.. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.<br /><br />Well to the actual plot of the film.<br /><br />Don\\'t spoil the experience for yourself! Don\\'t read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it\\'s a cinema experience that doesn\\'t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. Go see it because it is a good movie!\"\\n973,\"Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell\\'s part is very small and doesn\\'t add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.\"\\n974,\"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote \"\"The Milk Train Doesn\\'t Stop Here Anymore\"\" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money.<br /><br />Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.<br /><br />It\\'s so campy that among Taylor fans it\\'s probably considered a \"\"must see\"\" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you\\'re way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.\"\\n975,\"VIVA LA BAM This \"\"Jackass\"\" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his pals (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc). This show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on Bam\\'s torturing of his parents.<br /><br />I\\'m sorry to say this, Bam, but... you\\'re in no way as cool as you think you are. This ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly explaining that he\\'s going to do \"\"whatever the f***\"\" he wants to. How about you do something that is actually funny? I liked \"\"Jackass\"\" for what it was worth. The camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents\\' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.<br /><br />Not so with \"\"Viva la Bam\"\". We follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. The stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.<br /><br />\"\"Viva la Bam\"\" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed Margera\\'s already too big ego. I don\\'t recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.\"\\n976,\"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. Like many others on here, I don\\'t know how to categorize this film, it wasn\\'t scary or spooky so can\\'t be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can\\'t be a drama, there was no suspense so it can\\'t be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words, like \"\"ambiguity\"\" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn\\'t there. Like the Blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. This movie actually started off well with the family \"\"meeting\"\" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. It didn\\'t.\"\\n977,\"Schlocky \\'70s horror films...ya gotta love \\'em. In contrast to today\\'s boring slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />This is a B movie about the making of a B movie...that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add \"\"realism\"\". Unfortunately, \"\"realism\"\" is something they could have done without.<br /><br />John Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />The horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least there\\'s truth in advertising.) It\\'s just sad that the ghoul didn\\'t understand that there was a movie being made above him. How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work? Face it, you just can\\'t go around tugging on Satan\\'s coat and expect him to take it lying down.<br /><br />Sterno says perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.\"\\n978,\"I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be \"\" cool \"\" , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it\\'s charm was just as silly as it\\'s entertainment value ! Granted , the special effects do well on T.V. with the Series that started in 1964 , but for the BIG screen ?? I once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting ! I must agree about the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview. Obviously not well staged...or trained ! Overall , it\\'s pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and I still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake. This was probably one of Irwin Allen\\'s Biggest films and I think he thought a lot of it . Barabara Eden went on to play \"\" Genie \"\" on T.V. Micheal Ansara was her Husband . Now that is a cool part about this film ! I always enjoyed seeing real life Husband and Wife teams star in the same movie . Neat !\"\\n979,\"This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kong\\'s \\'New Wave\\' that began with Tsui Hark\\'s \"\"ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain\"\". Tsui set a tone for the New Wave\\'s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. \"\"Burning Paradise\"\" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.<br /><br />It\\'s not that there isn\\'t humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.<br /><br />When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the \\'abbot\\' of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very incarnation of Milton\\'s Satan from \"\"Paradise Lost\"\": \"\"Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven!\"\" And if he can\\'t get to Satan\\'s hell soon enough, he\\'ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.<br /><br />That\\'s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: It\\'s not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. Thus there\\'s a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.<br /><br />Of course, fortunately, the film doesn\\'t end there. Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how, see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.\"\\n980,\"Now I don\\'t hate cheap movies. I just don\\'t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad\\'s camcorder. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a MOVIE, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes.<br /><br />Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn\\'t. Maybe I hate it because it\\'s cheap, has the dumbest plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER and the really, really, really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of films EVER. Even Tom Savini can\\'t save this.<br /><br />Seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.\"\\n981,\"A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they\\'ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem \"\"solved\"\". They are of course \"\"out foxed\"\" at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.<br /><br />The\"\"film\"\" version ,and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them .They\\'ll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book.\"\\n982,\"As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! But on behalf of its producers I must say it doesn\\'t fall into any known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! It\\'s a \"\"Neurological drama\"\" ! It saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person\\'s brain.<br /><br />It\\'s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one. It drives you speechless, all you members go numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf.<br /><br />No small feat for such a sort of a \"\"movie\"\".<br /><br />The only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!\"\\n983,\"For a film made in Senegal, based, I guess loosely on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film doesn\\'t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films.<br /><br />Ms. Gai as the Karmen of the title is very good to look at. Her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />This is a Karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real Carmen, she is not!<br /><br />We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.\"\\n984,\"This is a very noir kind of episode. It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney--daughter in law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen goes in the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. He then discovers Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect.<br /><br />This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story once again. Rocky suggests that by Jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn\\'t think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. It\\'s a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky isn\\'t just some clueless old man either. As he says \"\"You come to me because I\\'m your father. And I\\'m smarter than you!\"\" This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts.<br /><br />This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the \"\"Dark Shadows\"\" series and went on to play Laura Banner, Bruce\\'s wife in the \"\"Incredible Hulk\"\" series a few years later. She looks terrific here.<br /><br />This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family. This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend.<br /><br />Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent. I guess they figured it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. <br /><br />Not a lot of the typical \"\"Rockford\"\" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.\"\\n985,\"The Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events, and i\\'ve been a wrestling fan for a good few years now. The other shows may have better matches, but i\\'ve always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement.<br /><br />I\\'m not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don\\'t see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. I will comment on the quality of them though.<br /><br />We have the standard 4 matches, and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw.<br /><br />Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. This proves to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match i\\'d recommend watching. It\\'s hard to sum up without giving away the winner.<br /><br />Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster, be whoever it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala... well this time it\\'s Heidenreich. Its also a casket match. Typical Undertaker fare. Watch if you\\'re a fan. I have to admit i am, purely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.<br /><br />The next two matches are the title matches. For once Smackdown manages to upstage Raw. Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti-climax and let down to end it. Raw\\'s match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i\\'m a fan of both guys involved.<br /><br />Now to the main reason i love the event, the rumble. It\\'s a pretty good one this year. Coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win, and it may not prove a big surprise, but hey, its very enjoyable. There are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. There is the token guy who doesn\\'t make it to the ring, the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. It has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the Vince McMahon entrance.<br /><br />I\\'d recommend this show. Not the WWE on top form, but its still good. Add it to your collection.\"\\n986,\"I remember this in a similar vein to the Young Ones. We\\'d stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other.<br /><br />We called one of our mates \"\"Zipmole Watkins\"\" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of \\'restyling\\' on his nose by the Back Street Abortionist.<br /><br />Lots of great lines \"\"Remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. Take it easy guy!\"\" - Gandhi as a local shopkeeper.<br /><br />Tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a barman \"\"It\\'s no good Amanda I\\'ll never make it as a bar man\"\" Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people about the match \"\"See the match last night? I thought Woodcock played well\"\" After a string of failed conversations the curly haired Arsenal star was sitting at the bar: \"\"See the match last night?\"\" \"\"Yeah. I thought I played well\"\"<br /><br />We still do odd stupid lines now - \"\"Reg and Ralph..... or....... Ralph and Reg. Reg, Reg... Reg Reg Reg Reg\"\"<br /><br />Lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - \"\"And he\\'ll mark your packages \\'Return To Sender\"\"<br /><br />Good old Danny Peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers\\' evenings sir.<br /><br />**Update - I found a couple of episodes on tape - I\\'m going to upload the Gandhi sketch to Youtube **\"\\n987,\"Destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. With great pun and humour, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. *prediction* the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too. I guarantee it.\"\\n988,\"Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically talented sisters give-up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them. After some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which changes the lives of all those invited. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of Protestant northern Europe and the sensuousness of the Catholic south. It is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A profoundly uplifting film.\"\\n989,\"This movie was way over-hyped. A lot of the viewers, who thought this was \"\"amazing\"\" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don\\'t mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying \"\"it\\'s the greatest movie ever done\"\". It\\'s just crap on a stick. It also didn\\'t help that the story line was sooo crappy. I don\\'t understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and I also don\\'t understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It\\'s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...\"\"It will all be done on a computer\"\". This was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I\\'m very upset with myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, don\\'t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.\"\\n990,\"It is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. This one came out a day before that other one with Tom Cruise. Didn\\'t they do that with Truman Capote the same year, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting.<br /><br />Writer/Director David Michael Latt didn\\'t have Steven Spielberg\\'s budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide.<br /><br />The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of Rhett Giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god.<br /><br />Gary Busey was creepy as an army LT.\"\\n991,\"I dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. \"\"Bat People\"\" (which I saw under the title \"\"It Lives By Night\"\") is just such a movie. You can\\'t watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on \"\"Night Gallery\"\", and not one of the better ones, either. <br /><br />The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (Actually, you\\'d think if he was turning into a real bat, he\\'d be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood\\'s the word.) In spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists that he\\'s just having an \\'allergic reaction\\' to the rabies shots. Meanwhile, the world\\'s most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). Also meanwhile, the doctor\\'s wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction. <br /><br />It\\'s not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (Okay, it IS pretty bad, but it\\'s bad in a clichéd, wooden, professional way). It\\'s just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved.<br /><br />I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, BUT:<br /><br />1)The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT, and not just channel Dennis Weaver. <br /><br />2)He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole \"\"Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns Into A Bat\"\" scenario. <br /><br />3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his \\'episodes\\', instead of resorting to \"\"Man Has A Seizure\"\" page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. <br /><br />4) He needed to rework the whole \\'wife\\' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. <br /><br />I would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It\\'s bad, but it isn\\'t bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. Still better than \"\"Battlefield Earth\"\" or \"\"Waterworld\"\", though.\"\\n992,\"Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. The two stars work great together, and--what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting \"\"Irkel\"\" and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this film with your kids. If you don\\'t laugh throughout it, you must not have been paying attention.\"\\n993,\"Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I can\\'t think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack haven\\'t disappointed me ever since. I would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled.\"\\n994,\"On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching. But on starting to view it, then I was hooked. In the same way that the Tina Turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. The acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who hasn\\'t yet watched it. It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.\"\\n995,\"Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. Spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don\\'t get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was a different world. Filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does that take away from the experience? HECK NO! That\\'s what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did that when I was young!) to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to Auggie Ben Doggie\\'s \"\"nah, just a little headache\"\" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual Star Wars films. Rent it. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And may the Farce be with you. Always.\"\\n996,\"I hated it. I hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. This film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. After the first half hour, I fastfowarded through the DVD version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. I became angered that I had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.\"\\n997,\"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche\\'s on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set\\'s off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"\"house of the dead.\"\" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character\\'s even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I\\'m sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F\"\\n998,\"If you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do I need to go on? It\\'s message is good, but I have seen them been handled better in several other films. The acting isn\\'t even any good. This movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny (not intensional though)because of it\\'s surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. Why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband.<br /><br />Honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. And if your not happy with my preview,seriously I\\'m an open minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film.\"\\n999,\"This is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. However, here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film:<br /><br />- Handgun bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons. It doesn\\'t matter how many times you shoot at the Komodo, bullets just won\\'t go near it.<br /><br />- The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Cobra, or a giant Komodo dragon, is just to stand there. The exception to this rule is if you\\'ve been told to stay very still, in which case you should run off, until the Komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there, expecting defeat.<br /><br />- Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching.<br /><br />- $5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested.<br /><br />- Members of elite army units don\\'t see giant Komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized beings. Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it.<br /><br />- When filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous.<br /><br />- When you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person.<br /><br />- When you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety<br /><br />- Reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they\\'re exposing. Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism.<br /><br />- Handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip. Despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo.<br /><br />- Expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment\\'s hesitation or regret. These cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves.<br /><br />- The blonde girl really is the stupid one.<br /><br />- The same girl that says not to go into a house because a Komodo dragon can easily run right through it, thus making it unsafe, takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody says a word about it.<br /><br />- High-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets.<br /><br />- Genetically-modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day, but don\\'t grow at all in the weeks either side.<br /><br />- The military routinely destroys entire islands when people don\\'t meet contact deadlines.<br /><br />- Men with guns don\\'t necessarily change the direction they\\'re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they just keep shooting into the air.<br /><br />- The better looking you are, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures.<br /><br />- Women\\'s intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds.<br /><br />- Any time you\\'re being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age.<br /><br />- Animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for \\'swearing\\' at the same volume.<br /><br />- Old Israeli and Russian planes are regularly used by the US Military.\"'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["text\n","### The data is in the form of a text."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t0pXHG5N5cOK"},"source":["# Text Normalization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tO68tqQI5cOK"},"source":["### Text normalization is the process of transforming a text into a canonical (standard) form.

They are right as this is exactly what happened with me.The first thing that struck me about Oz was its utality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word GO. Trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence. Its is hardcore in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans Muslims gangstas Latinos Christians Italians Irish and more....so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance...OZ doesnt mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal I couldnt say I was ready for it but as I watched more I developed a taste for Oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence but injustice (crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n","neg: 0.176, neu: 0.758, pos: 0.066, compound: -0.9907, \n","A wonderful little production. The filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimeBBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece. The actors are extremely well chosen Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwells murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.\n","neg: 0.053, neu: 0.765, pos: 0.182, compound: 0.967, \n","I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy.

While Ive never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman.This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends.\n","neg: 0.116, neu: 0.675, pos: 0.21, compound: 0.9579, \n","Basically theres a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks theres a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.OK first of all when youre going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama!

Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.The acting is good under Mr. Matteis direction. Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive.We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\n","neg: 0.052, neu: 0.8, pos: 0.148, compound: 0.9744, \n","Probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring.

The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didnt care much for the romantic angle as a  year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.But about a year or so later I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star Janet Leigh was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula.

Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the atwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how hes not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we dont really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. However the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier making GeneticallyMutatedsoldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his topsecret research on an island that reminds me of SPOILER Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjackwoods. We havent even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience meaning most of it will suck.There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (thats poop for you simpletons) from a far if you wanna take a wiff go ahead..

But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects.

M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straighttovideo movies I saw back in the s ...

This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.Ive read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. The Cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we dont want any more? Personally I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him.Weve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes I do agree that the genre is a bit overworked. The s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked but most failed. But The Cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the ain of another. Instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. The Cell wants to let you see what its all about and not how its all about and I guess thats what some people dont like. True I do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the ight visuals when inside the ain of another. Nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldnt be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like. If it were up to me itd at least get nominated for best picture.Ive noticed that Ive kind of been repeating myself. Not because theres nothing else to say but because I cant stress enough how fantastic I thought The Cell was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy. I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley.

Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and ings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil Warera Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.Then again calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough the film opens with a (quite literally) quickanddirty battle sequence that puts Glory director Edward Zwick shame. However Cold Mountain is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman played by Jude Law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind Ada Monroe played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldiers tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.Cold Mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile back at the farm Adas cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Adas rescue is the course toughasnails Ruby Thewes played by Renée Zellweger who helps Ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have ought upon Ada.Within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Rubys deadbeat father Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by the war of Northern aggression mostly for the worse. The dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century its hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake Cold Mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.\n","neg: 0.143, neu: 0.751, pos: 0.106, compound: -0.9555, \n","Taut and organically gripping Edward Dmytryks Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.Bivouacked in Washington DC a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a strangers apartment where Robert Ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum whos assigned to Ryans outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper) who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan naturally does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt) while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role however is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable.The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to Youngs reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit). At least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).Curiously Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it  the novel its based on (Richard Brooks The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gaybashing murder. But homosexuality in  was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antiSemitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).But while the change from homophobia to antiSemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly. The victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though (or especially since) theres a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating Ryans murderous rage.\n","neg: 0.15, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.058, compound: -0.9921, \n","Ardh Satya is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema.

Unlike any Police of other cities in India Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether.

His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies & incidences of his fathers Atrocities on his mother. Anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction.

Resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars also turning him to an alcoholic.The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative.

When were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italianspeaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamos cash tell him that  dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth. Having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamos troubles. This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of  a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his nonlife Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous. The first half of the film may be described as slow by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo  the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would  is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dellAmore or LImbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia) Le Conseguenze dellAmore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause (if indeed there is one). The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in  years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations Le Conseguenze dellAmore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postinolike fare more La Vita è Bellastyle films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dellAmore LImbalsamatore and others.

I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was % wrong.Having watched it I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I dont usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the antireligious humor is tame (and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show).

I thought that Gods Army was okay and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting and I thought well maybe it will get better. Unfortunately it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders  Mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.Dutchers only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.The conclusion which Im assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable (cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy.

In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kaels THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz  Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site Kael overstated her case.There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston  the Henry Luce clone) Thatchers memoirs Bernstein Jed Leland Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kanes story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incident.This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes like KANE it is about a legendary business leader  here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy) a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators  they are Garners right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public  she sees only the flaws in Henry.Typical example: Although he worked his way up Tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Toms confrontation with the Union in a major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henrys wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Unions headquarters  killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.Im not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANEs success (few films do  including all of Orson Welles other films) but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully ought home.When they marry Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson) the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom and presents him with a son  but it turns out to be Eves son by Toms son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.The film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could ing in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.\n","neg: 0.094, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.114, compound: 0.9422, \n","Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means its still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.The genres wellknown weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points.

Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest this is Presented in Shaw Scope just like the good old days.This film is a simple story of good versus evil told in  acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by % by incoming manchu gangsters. They cant do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences) but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods  kinda like Mr Miyagis style in Karate Kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox way.Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used adnausem in Hollywood flicks they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to!

The case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun Jimmy Davis Franchot Tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like Jimmy Davis are forced to take up arms for their country.Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend Fred P. Willis Spencer Tracy ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmys unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmys good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. Its when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmys proposal of marriage to her!With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred whos still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and nonviolent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York Citys underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.Jimmys life of crime came full circle when Rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a Valentine Day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy oke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law.

As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption wartime sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her ief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who coauthored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcocks sensibilities.This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate  year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who dont believe his farfetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock Patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.In good form for this outing Hitchcock ews a national network of demure old ladies average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. Its a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of Hitchcocks more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the wartime shooting ban on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcocks most well known films its a popular bmovie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual  terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcocks cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcocks original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!\n","neg: 0.134, neu: 0.726, pos: 0.14, compound: -0.7122, \n","I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago.Its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my God the illiance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay) sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway.This is a characterdriven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to ing it to life. Finney only  years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but illiant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use though. For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the longsuffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been.Although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay.I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end.

If the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter  but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive beautifully filmed turd. Its not that shocking its not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it  rent it. I give it a  for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;)  the filming is good and it does have some gore (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that  absolutely nothing going for this overhyped mess. On the other hand  GENESIS  Cerdas sequel to AFTERMATH (now available as a double feature released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I dont care for AFTERMATH at all GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...\n","neg: 0.079, neu: 0.728, pos: 0.193, compound: 0.9899, \n","I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written.

Turns out its way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever. Theres a problem and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. Its safe to say its a pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very worst ever made its there just for horndog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their ains in their other heads.In this case were given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by A Murderer as hes credited. First off the director Kazuo Gaira Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in (or phoned in take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like its from another movie. Then once settled into the house theres a wrestling scene thats poorly choreographed and shot (yeah we really need to see him all there) and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer who like DAmatos creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.Now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying however that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene actually is kind of cool) and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name I cant remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through Gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors (youd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one where its just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!)

As the story unfolds in real life and fiction Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.The Number  offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number  reminds me that hes still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just cant get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film thats titled The Number  is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach its horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celeating that film has finally finished.The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didnt even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts.

Not having seen him in  years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to America with the help of the housekeeper/nanny determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended called Precious (Barnes) is nothing but a golddigger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady) they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their fathers accountant (King). The man he chooses is a fulltime drunk (Auer) but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.This is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by Auer Milland Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis of course is on young Durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifullytrained singer. In fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult  she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful Il Bacio in a police station.One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by Charles Winninger not want his children around  until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the golddigger isnt all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman. In fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here  she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.Very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.\n","neg: 0.021, neu: 0.818, pos: 0.161, compound: 0.9961, \n","If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England.

Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isnt a Hollywood movie.My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends. Heres where Daniel DayLewis reaches an acting climax. Ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animated. Wheel out the cripple!

I was never completely lost but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.If it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good. The movies most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making Heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you dont see the gods and theres no real certainty that they exist. So its got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesnt do anything useful with them.Bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons.

Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.The story begins much like any other Mario game Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celeation at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peachs castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Lumas home a floating space station here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space stations Power Stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach thus the adventure begins.The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the Wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some  games.My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at  lives. Still these minor problems aside its a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging.

Heres what I have to say about it. First of all the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger Roman Polanski Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie Ive ever seen. Second of all in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his (Van Bebbles) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and Im assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions I asked if he was trying to present the outsider Mtv sex drugs and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f*** you shut the f*** up this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!Well anyway I didnt even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film Youve heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family. Excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in Gods name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock n roll mind of a man who couldnt even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the publics image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlies work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented.All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc. Case in point. Even the disclaimer Based on a True Story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.All I can say is this when the film ended I got a free beer so Im glad I went but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question.

It is rare that a second or third tier actor such as Quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film.

The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to The Reign Of Terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film Man Of Iron () had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play The Danton Affair written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical.

There was a court battle with the White Zombie films rights owners who didnt want the Halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word Zombie appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle.

It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes . Close ups predominated it. Close ups of walls humans and of many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of closeups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so illiant. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes.

Meatballs is the story of lowrent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a twoday Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.The film is sprinkled with mediumsized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while hes sleeping. Morty or Micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course its up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudys situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered. Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just adlibbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words Murray might as well have said to Makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesnt fit in. But before its all over Murrays performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesnt matter. This is a pretty good film on many levels.

Assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. Englishs experience  according to her IMDb bio  is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. Englishs talents didnt translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face) but where did she have a chance to use her talent?!

Which ings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But of course the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robins journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity sensitivity and heart; not just a cute impression although it was even deadon. (On an unrelated note I noticed that Robins struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman who was underappreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively but thats the Taxi behind the scenes biopic.)All in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all never melodramatic like I suspected and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!).

The film a Bgrade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the socalled Bloody Shootout (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store) being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout) expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano a washedup football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his sons coach). But once executed Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls a hamburger without the fries) whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making Silvanos life a misery.Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film with Meeker chasing Silvano using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache) a drag queen a clown & a standup comedian) a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesnt stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle) to pay Silvano back for killing Meekers wife.Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of. But that is the films main flaw since theres nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good with Keith delivering the best performance supported ably by Kove as well as Paul Koslo who plays the washedup cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.\n","neg: 0.196, neu: 0.679, pos: 0.125, compound: -0.9928, \n","Ye Lous film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her exlover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting doesnt help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I dont mind dark movies but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but I dont think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the th Century and I dont believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments dont add to its watchability.The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films ooding and looking generally annoyed. However at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.All in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. /\n","neg: 0.144, neu: 0.778, pos: 0.078, compound: -0.9561, \n","After hearing about George Orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life Im now  but never having read the book I am totally confused as to what Ive just seen.I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as im sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes.

He allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). Its a heady endeavorso much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. Some may shun Coppolas unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****\n","neg: 0.062, neu: 0.798, pos: 0.14, compound: 0.9815, \n","This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying  save time. the only upside  me was that the actor who played finny was cute.

Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first othel; once the profits start coming in Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action.

Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen and in particular P & P is not about passion sexual tension or love. Its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored so that the Bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style danceorgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the illiance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots  particularly in this film  to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour  which IS Pride & Prejudice both Austens methodology and her appeal  was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this pofaced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it. You cant lose Jane Austens technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxow cinematography.Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clearsighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeths wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clearsightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation  and not genuinely raging either; no these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austens Elizabeth (at least in Austens eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety Knightleys Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strongminded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen  delivered with remarkable clumsiness  and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.\n","neg: 0.117, neu: 0.728, pos: 0.154, compound: 0.9922, \n","Ive always enjoyed films that depict life as it is.

Ten years after Phantasm we have had an additional three featurefilms released from the boys at the WB SubZero Return of the Joker and now Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.The animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures).  its quite nicely done and just as sleek as Return of the Jokers animation. There is also some use of CGI but its minor compared to the overabundance of it in SubZero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans rodentshaped hearts.Kevin Conroy as always does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Its also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon) Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock) Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romanticrelationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).Villains were also great  especially given that Rupert Thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season.Overall while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan you will love the fiveminute short Chase Me.\n","neg: 0.005, neu: 0.847, pos: 0.148, compound: 0.9959, \n","I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made ...and simply is. Its oneandahalf hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since its a horrormovie. And I (usually) like horrormovies. Ive no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. Its no spectacle other than that its simply grotesque. Its so lame it even gets boring and really quick too.The worst thing (if the above wasnt bad enough for ya) about this movie is that theyve tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project by filming with cheap handheldcameras. But (again this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the Blair Which sure enough theres an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film theres no other explanation than: Hey yall we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!! The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you cant make out what theyre saying. Also no effort has been made to make anything any better soundwise or other wise.Than finally theres the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap eurohouse to the worst grungy hardrock...My advise: Dont watch this under ANY circumstances.\n","neg: 0.241, neu: 0.691, pos: 0.068, compound: -0.9964, \n","Why cant a movie be rated a zero?

Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age there may be worse movies Ive seen but thankfully I cant remember them. The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. The special effects looked like a fifth graders C+ diorama set in a shoebox. The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it without the gun having been reloaded!

The characters typical American teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. Its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school HORROR!

But whatever chances youre ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within  minutes: its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian uppermiddle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neoNazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and theyre made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube  only here it lasts NINETY TWO (countem) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funnybad.Weve all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong  theres gangrape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially Kids and Bully) but Clarks films  though also moralist and sexploitative  are highclass masterworks compared to this crap.I dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our ains by repetition and exhaustion  you DO get numbminded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesnt care a bit about technique (the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling) but hes a narcissistic controlfreak: he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure  he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism (handheld video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc). Damn he cant even decide WHERE to put his camera (theres use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it.Its very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepyeyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineos Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir). Here hes told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like webcam porn).The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical (?) middleclass youth  Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what hes trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middleclass youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE theyre middleclass and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neofascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldnt tell). With its dogmatic selfrighteousness headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a  reasons but above all its harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument.

In Azumi  we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I wont hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumis way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.This ings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the Death side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no ones surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi  the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi  was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been oken and the action should have been further enriched.The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation I wont lie and Ill admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film but Ill step right up and say that after watching Azumi  the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what its worth Azumi : Death or Love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying.\n","neg: 0.125, neu: 0.697, pos: 0.178, compound: 0.986, \n","This has to be the worst piece of garbage Ive seen in a while.Heath Ledger is a heartthrob?

It isnt that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your ain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that Ive read on one hand but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.Still Stuart Townsends voiceover narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitts vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNEDs limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.However Ill give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.The film opens with a very cool Gothrock zoom & splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly. Its as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Wheres the pale blue makeup? Scene after scene I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salems Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Lets see what else can I say? It wasnt too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot.

Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans as well as billions of humans the world over who dont happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen.

Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion.

Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacobys performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewarts as Claudius are well worth the effort.It never ceases to amaze me how clear Hamlet is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of Hamlet has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlets indecision Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlets character together with the aid of Shakespeares full script.Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says I am very proud revengeful ambitious... Hamlet is extremely upset not only for his fathers death (and suspected murder) or his mothers marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is therefore impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his fathers ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must out the Kings secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius guilt in public he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge the throne AND the damnation of Claudius soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing.

Salvatore a middleaged man who hopes for a more fruitful life persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily take the arduous journey across the raging seas and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous hell be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while theyre aboard the ship to the New World.The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the ight yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: Give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing mathematics puzzles etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular Salvatores mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesnt change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating.

Its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting matchups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know I know thats hard to do when you consider Custers Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and its prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it.Theres a lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time. Custers arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.Ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in Custers first meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadnt noticed it before in other films but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too.As for Flynn its interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagans depiction of General Custer in Santa Fe Trail both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers while in Flynns portrayal here its more than evident. But it doesnt come close to that of Richard Mulligans take on the military hero in s Little Big Man. Lets just say that one was a bit over the top.The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view. Earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custers character when he stated  You take glory with you when its your time to go.\n","neg: 0.045, neu: 0.846, pos: 0.109, compound: 0.9894, \n","The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction.

The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing Rank and BritishGaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter more cereal approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any overproduced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburgers The th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman a favorite of mine.

Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film. It is simply illiant. The start of the film has the aliens spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the films title in amazing shining white and blue stating THE THING. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection it is tense scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didnt get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenters greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge.

Pretty Woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute were talking about here has a great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this happy Hooker type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame. Secondly Pretty Woman insults romance itself Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination.  out of  of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her its the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm? wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano please.Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most.

James McNallys summary of the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity.The film is shot on handheld DV which some might find offputting but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.Despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the worlds dogs but also undercutting a number of interviewees comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. To a degree this evoked Michael Moores recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way) but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls The Sorrow and the Pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of salt of the earth French peasants as the stars.

However a glitch turns up  Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language.

There is a military adviser credited who is also apparently a retired U.S. Marine making it even more baffling that this incredible each of protocol and law went unnoticed. Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA then buried in very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there even was a body. The U.S. government is still finding the missing from WWII and it takes months to identify the remains. Military shot down remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been positively identified or after years of red tape. Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark but not in the U.S. Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with or respect for the U.S. military.Beyond that there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. Having a script that worked might have helped but this one seems to have been made up on the spot working from Cliffs Notes. Theres no way to know if the script was this awful originally or if it was the auteur or the middlemanagement kids at the studio who bear responsibility. Either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made.\n","neg: 0.122, neu: 0.809, pos: 0.069, compound: -0.9677, \n","We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age with the likes of The Four Feathers () and Zulu simply because the Imperial age was for the most part British. Here in The Wind and the Lion we see a wonderful rendering of Americas own Imperial age.Americas projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility is smitten by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (Politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) What makes this story different are the terrific production values  faultless photography composition and editing  the terrific casting  the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy  and vivid history.Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be Sean Connerys noble igand Candace Bergens feisty heroine John Hustons wily John Hay or Steve Kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant Roosevelts Big Stick.

And I must say the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming one after the other. I mean seriously just one more music number and it would have oke even with RENT.Furthermore I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didnt care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphys character died of a drug overdose I knew I should have been sad but I just couldnt feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.Finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.\n","neg: 0.074, neu: 0.805, pos: 0.121, compound: 0.9599, \n","One of Starewiczs longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewiczs films. The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stopmotion animation makes for a new twist on Starewiczs old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and peoples feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewiczs utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devils club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. Overall Starewicz is able to update his style of filmmaking to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.\n","neg: 0.122, neu: 0.79, pos: 0.088, compound: -0.9136, \n","Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male Im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own thing that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and eak out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didnt try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen.

The inspectors at Scotland Yard Higgins(IJoachim Fuchsberger)and his superior Sir John(Siegfried Schürenberg)certainly have their hands full with this case. It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas) who when she turns  is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SYs finest must figure out. The staff of the girls dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. Its a clever scheme where a driver Greaves(Günter Meisner)meets the convicts(..who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how. Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. Under suspicion are girls dormitory headmistress her author other a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the Bannister. Some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. The ending features multiple twists. Out of the Krimi films Ive seen THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with its colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain masterminds secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isnt used) the fake bible/water pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of startled victims the Greaves Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins abilities to get at the truth(..perhaps poking fun at knowitall British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)..I felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him. Higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues/facts often avoiding Sir John as much as possible. Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls executions. Id say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)examples of the Krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up its sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eyeopening(..and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off).\n","neg: 0.155, neu: 0.759, pos: 0.087, compound: -0.9962, \n","I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival  only a few days ago.

In the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director Curtis Harrington (Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?) and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (HushHushSweet Charlotte) in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but theres a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tapdancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. Were literally catapulted back to the s with a sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to lifeimprisonment for murder Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radioevangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. The script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced. Theres never a dull moment in Whats the matter with Helen although the singing tapdancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters. Shes downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady whos about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers combined! There are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house.

The genius who ought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a s French musical in viant colour. The opening voiceover with old embellished intertitles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. The camera backs off (or rather up) suddenly showing us the surprisingly illiant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first  seconds.Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of  girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes I speak French so I cant blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who eak into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue  minutes into the film.Im not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.It didnt get much better. Ill tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters.

However the whole thing sank without a trace and TV is probably better off for it.Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a made for TV way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor mans John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the World Order on counter Earth.But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this SciFi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.Ill give one example: in the original template for this pilot (Doppleganger) the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.In Stranded in Space the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound things start shaking and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats the director wasnt even shaking the camera or the set). Ive seen episodes of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this madeforTV mediocrity.And that in essence is whats wrong with Stranded In Space. No budget no time no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the scifi Fan Boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry guys it didnt work. Im sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away and never thought of it again except as a listing on their C.V. And thats what you the viewer will do.

Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful like Fargo for example. But usually they dont often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem. There doesnt seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in .DeVito plays an odd mammas boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite a caricature. She is loud ugly rude and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesnt have the guts to actually do it himself. Thats where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner Owens creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid wouldbe intellectual novelist who claims his exwife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. The night was.... Owen hears Larry wish his exwife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and murder Larrys exwife. Once it appears he has done so he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant. Its certainly never dull and often full of surprises.The acting is exceptional even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the offbeat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy filmmaking. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isnt too long and it is chock full of laughs.

Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him.Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesnt happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but youll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macae scenes that are less shocking than the one Ive mentioned but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half...lovely.The acting in The Fourth Man isnt anything to write home about but its solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and its a shame that he doesnt put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films Ive seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me its worth the effort.\n","neg: 0.049, neu: 0.807, pos: 0.145, compound: 0.994, \n","I accept that most s horror arent scary by todays standards but what the hell is this?

A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer I have seen may examples of both.On September  I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowskis Donnyook. Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the finished product) of this piece I can safely say it is a movie. And a student movie at that. It is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.Granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog. Steven Soderberghs sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind. This movie however has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then I feel this movie misses the point. What I got out of it is that Davies main aspiration is to change the face of rock n roll. However we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time SHOW dont TELL the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also Davie doesnt look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the s; he looks like hed be more comfortable in the early days of rock n roll posing as James Deans less talented other. In the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are ought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving Terrys father). If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction I will consider watching Napolean Dynamite again a film I could barely make it through the first time.As for the above mentioned dialog scenes I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between. Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? I dont think it is. When the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly overthetop outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal rational people. Working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film Al Hudsons and thats just because hes doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. However with Satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a selfindulgent misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. In the end we are left with a poor highschoolset knockoff of Zach Braffs amazing Garden State combined with the equally amazing Velvet Goldmine two films far more worthy of your time.Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this. The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. However the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. This is a student movie nothing more nothing less. If the movie holds any promise (and lets face it at this point it isnt going to come from the acting writing or directing) it is this: If IF the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; dont attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you.

In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim. Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil. The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz. Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc. For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking  year old boy  his older other is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and utish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little other pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote  Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes. There is one other good character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by eaking the rapists arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age  or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. Its a mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. Thats the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in. I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs.\n","neg: 0.188, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.087, compound: -0.9977, \n","When will I ever learn?)

In addition the viewer is presented with numerous hamhanded references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as overreverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age. However once youve heard it youve heard it and you dont need to hear it again. Unfortunately he is in the majority of the films scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film.

CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about Fulci who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from its wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie  this IS the goriest Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a illiant director.

Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. And youll never hear another screenplay feature the word butthorn either. Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from Lethal Weapon and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years earlier.

However just two years on and I find I cant remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldnt have made much of an impression. From what I do recall some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  werent as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic. Generally the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesnt lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddys Dead.An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the characters demise. The fact that the movies conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the films being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture was.Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain Robert Englunds innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddys mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. Its like Englunds crying out we know this is garbage  but youre paying to see it so whos the one laughing? And Im sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddys appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars and thats it. If this was the only Elm St. film youd ever seen you wouldnt get to know the character at all. Even as the character predeath in a flashback Englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated misplaced and not at all funny) irony.Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself Yaphet Kotto keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map upon which the Noel Cowardlike Freddy has wittily written youre f**ked. When prompted for the map Carlos responds well the map says were f**ked. Who wrote the screenplay Oscar Wilde?Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. Nice hearing from you Carlos quips Freddy hoping some better lines will come along. Its also worth noting that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into Freddys world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a D finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirements.The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the f**k up man and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddys Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.\n","neg: 0.16, neu: 0.751, pos: 0.089, compound: -0.9964, \n","Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the s but although it is undoubtedly utal violent and very downbeat this film from PouSoi Cheang isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thing.Edison Chen plays Pang a Cambodian hitman who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pangs love interest) Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hardhitting Asian hyperviolence (think along the lines of Chanwook Parks Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings shootings merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.Of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy and in its final moments Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a laughably overdramatic final scene Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.Whilst this film might not be a classic slice of Hong Kong excess with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals its still worth seeking out.\n","neg: 0.149, neu: 0.705, pos: 0.146, compound: -0.7562, \n","I watched this movie for the hot guyand even he sucked!

This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. A other dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster.

But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI and at the very worst an act of murder. Like most people when the siege at Waco was occurring I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. After seeing this I think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the U.S. government through his eccentric actions. Sure there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely hearteaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site the clueless testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats. Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current U.S. senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state  Im a Democrat pretty leftleaning too.

Its one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress couldnt do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady  I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting.The title fits this movie very well.

Its too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. I dont think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the Pang Brothers.The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so youll find absolutely zero original content in The Messengers. What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of Pulse a couple that could have come from The Birds one or two from The Others etc. Nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comes.Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie. In fact everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie. Im sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know so dont be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isnt there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow? Didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him?) it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling Boo!

Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this underappreciated group.Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival.

Some of the best acting came from a role that wasnt really important to the story that of Marcial the subintelligent yet humble drunkard.

However in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman hes much less comfortable.But his way with an epigram is peerless and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur really  he was the wit of the pair).The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence.

That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick Somebody Up There Likes Me. That movie might be number  but Gentleman Jim is a close number .The movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late s boxing was moving away from the utal days of bareknuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.Gentleman Jim is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the Gentleman Jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the end).At the end of Gentleman Jim the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT I can lick any man in the world of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey if you want realism watch Raging Bull instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie.

However when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time Ive ever spent at the cinema.In principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why Im rating this a .In this version Sara is a little too selfsacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar. Theres also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me; Saras father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset. While the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending it doesnt leave you thinking Oh puhleeze.About the only things true to the book were:. Saras father being a soldier . The lines between Sara and her father (Are you learning me by heart?/No. I know you by heart. You are inside my heart.) . Saras friendship with Becky and her adopting Lottie (although this last one wasnt developed as much as it could have been) . The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was illiantly done. . The basic core  a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly  is there but thats about all that is.People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins  aged  and  respectively  who were big fans of this film until they read the book.If all you want is a feelgood family film then this delivers. If youre looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact if youve read the book) dont waste time with this one. Its such a shame; with a cast like this if theyd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.Am I harping on about read the book this and read the book that a little too much?

Theres plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said the film has several glaring flaws. hours is simply too long for the human attention span. Its clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his nine inning concept. Its not even a tight  hours... the pace on every segment is slow almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. Isnt baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional hearteak yakking about baseball as a metaphor baseball as Americana the psychology and theology of baseball... enough!

As a rural guy coming to Beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success. Troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity. The ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.But what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director Zhang Yang and his actors ing to this journey. No clichés no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims. Hongshen Jia is in his midtwenties. Hes a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon hes the cool actor idolized by youth. He was hot in the early nineties. He always had to be the most fashionable. He needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts friendsand roles But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his selfcriticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational selfdoubt selfhatred I didnt know how to act I felt like a phonyand to readily available drugs to counter them. He says I had to get high to do what director wanted. So his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity. Hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittentand doggedly his own. Solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoorsnot in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways idges and highrises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. I started to open up he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancers positioning (clumsy graceful humorous telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night. Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and TV and bangs his head till bloody against his John Lennon Forever poster. He has let down his iconic antiestablishment artistbut hes the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as Johns son (Yoko Ono) and adopts his Mother Mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble. (the wrenching shaking pain in the parkhallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) Music is so much more real than acting he says. And speaks of Lennons influence as showing me a new way. In the mental institute the lifesaving apples (resistance nourishment) reflect Lennons presence as does Hongshens need to rehang his heros poster in his redecorated room.If Lennons influence is spiriting Hongshens fathers influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink) it is Fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that hes Chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. Its this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor (the blue jeans Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father: all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit. And to Hongshens emphatic you are NOT my father he softly replies why cant a peasant be your father? Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst. he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. You are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strapdown incurred for refusing medicine. Back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant backtoback fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: its a good chance to think about my life. And I might add become a New Actor one bound to art and life. Like Lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity.\n","neg: 0.092, neu: 0.779, pos: 0.129, compound: 0.9834, \n","I have watched this movie countless times and never failed to be charmed by its homely simplicity sincerity and goodness.

Alien was a fantastic dramatic and well made horror/scifi. Predator was a great scifi/action messabout. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw Alien versus Predator. It too has an average grading of over  stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU.Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hyid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldnt here.A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) I would calculate at the very least  odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet.An edgy thrillertype scenario is introduced with an excon returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute/not cute boy is the excons other by the way. Yes theyre clever these director others whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.Guess what happens next?

If you really wanted to shock titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. Its filmed and paced badly. Its acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of scifi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you.

Its peak years were between  and . One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. She was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.Gary Graver the director was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with Monica Gayles screen presence makes Sandra the Making of a Woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience.

Playing reallife boxing champ Jim Corbett Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celeated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith. He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bareknuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. The next day he gets a chance via Smith to gain entrance to the judges private club. He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the clubs resident boxer. His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.) Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role. He looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn. At this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. Bond is incredibly burly awny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it. Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynns manager. The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynns rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types. The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. A few of the sets are amazingly presented. Some of Smiths gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. Its a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but its also so much more. Some of it (like the character traits shown by Flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) One line is particularly memorable: I believe you like me more than I like you but its entirely possible that I love you more than you love me.

Aside from one or two REAL stinkers Id probably watch just about anything with them in the film as I am a huge fan of Hollywoods golden age of the s and s. However no matter how much I love their films I just cant recommend this film.The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. The two havent yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing. It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it outespecially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling!! In hindsight perhaps I should have just turned it off then! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him xrayed and nurses him back to health. He in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her. Despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.Once home however all isnt rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy. The film plays it all for laughs but frankly Fondas behaviors were really creepyspying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening ANY man she treats tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal away his wife. He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but its all supposed to be for laughs. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order! But oddly she gets mad but just cant stay mad at Fonda because hes so........? I cant think of the right wordcreepy is all that comes to mind!!! Later out of the blue multimillionaire Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store. Then through magical thinking he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the pastso a job apparently cures anger and suspicions. When this job falls through the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They dont go any further with the story but I assume based on Fondas character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients.The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together nor did the final Horatio Alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world. They were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a creepy little film! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films.\n","neg: 0.145, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.125, compound: -0.9496, \n","I find the critique of many IMDb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to GET AWAY from it all.In this case however I have to say it was BAD.

The director and cowriter says he wanted to mix genres  in this case drama and comedy. Well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. Additionally the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his exlovers son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty exlover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them  either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael her exlover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow balls chance in hell.

For le Moko although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time  a place he cant leave because the moment he does he knows hell be arrested.Boyers performance was good and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character  a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. The movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which Ill mention two. First was the idea that the police wouldnt enter the Casbah. That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly. So neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko  hardened criminal mastermind that he was  could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her essentially giving himself up. I understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because hes shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.This is worth watching for Boyer and to a lesser extent Calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. /\n","neg: 0.091, neu: 0.798, pos: 0.111, compound: 0.8037, \n","Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isnt a perfect movie but Im pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings.

I’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big other program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven’t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin’) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay.

The plot has holes but the lead performers make it work.Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Keridge) does a great job as a woman of  who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. She is performing illiantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.Meanwhile Julias sister and otherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda (Arlen AguayoStewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. Amanda is about  years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parents murder that she has become mute. Needless to say Julias hour days get longer caring for Amanda.Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia.The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other. You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.We discover that Julias sister and otherinlaw (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by  of their former associates. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime Amanda. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchips location.Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.What struck me about the plot were major holes. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity. The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming.

Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S. The film is lighthearted; youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. All of the films characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfections.Ive been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because now Im really geeked to give it a try.

The mysterious block is dug out and ought to a research station on Antarctica. Julian Rome a former SETIworker is ought in to decipher the message. Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. Soon the object is in the open. The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. It is decided to open the object but just before that is done Julian decodes the signal. Do not open. But too late and the object explodes as it is finally eached and two things unleashed on earth. The first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. And Washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.Comments: The movie holds a few surprises. One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way. Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. It is never really explained why Washington know so much why Washington is able to command Russian submarines why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now. It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English. Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose English why?). But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus send their Do not open message encoded! And finally the end is as open as an end can be.The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good./\n","neg: 0.067, neu: 0.83, pos: 0.104, compound: 0.9527, \n","This movie features Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club.

There were a few interesting moments (e.g. Judy Tenutas scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judyism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. Those moments however were few and far between ... and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence. I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once Id seen the whole thing.

It has a great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when shes not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that theres anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.The music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. Theres also lots of slick gunplay thats very well done.I would probably have given this movie  or  stars if it wasnt for two things. The first being a silly bar room awl that occurs about  minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the awl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yumas cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasnt at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? All that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.\n","neg: 0.086, neu: 0.795, pos: 0.12, compound: 0.6637, \n","The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And oh yes theres romance and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in . It must be emphasized that this movie is a story st not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would ing similar films such as Singin in the Rain() & Dick Van DykeCarl Reiners The Comic(). What is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in . We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the silent era Buster Keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in  silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennetts film legacy. It doesnt take a genius to realize this movie is a positive reworking of Mack Sennetts and Mabel Normands life. The character Michael Linnett Connors is Mack Sennett whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly of course is Mabel. Sennett had the pie throwings the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton Ben Turpin(cameo) Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. Not only all that but Sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. As most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career started in  as an actor then writer director & producer. He semi retired in  with about  films to his credit. He had worked with the best such as Charlie Chaplin Gloria Swanson Bing Crosby W.C. Fields Keaton Harry Langdon Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers(in Way Up Thar).As film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career Mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next  years. In  he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in  for a lifetime of work. In the s his presence was still felt e.g. Here Come the CoEds()where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Macks Wandering Willies()is done. In  The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennetts Crosby films.  years later ought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his knack of always associating with the right people a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show came about later in the year.  ought a rerelease of his greatest triumph Tillies Punctured Romance() with sound. In  he was honored on TVs This Is Your Life then his autobiography The King of Comedy() which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade was published.  ought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello as he had a cameo in A&C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in  another tribute with the compilation film The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. In the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. As we get to the silver haired Mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here I am!. When he rises to give a speech a short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey I know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual. Maybe this movie will help.\n","neg: 0.018, neu: 0.816, pos: 0.166, compound: 0.9992, \n","It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam Hoss and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships some go good some not so good its just life. And were less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact. But thats if Bonanza were done today.But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped the secret of Bonanzas success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinch.The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didnt care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way I describe.This was just the beginning for Michael Landon how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big Dan Blocker left the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time David Canary Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big loyal but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesnt look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the Cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like  Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.And if they werent real they should have been.\n","neg: 0.021, neu: 0.812, pos: 0.166, compound: 0.9984, \n","Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.Boy what a terrible film. Its so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc) because Hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.Mind you the version on the DVD is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD Edwards cut  scenes (!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are  minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someones death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. Theres no catalyst in this story.One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews (and Edwards) previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. Its no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in  that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment Ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julies MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending birds eye view of Julie running towards Hudsons plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSIC.The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer born from a German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in midsentence. Im like what happened here?The comedy bits are unfunny and cringeworthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Wheres Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. Whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. Thats one slow moving train there. The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film  stars) but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant did we really need to see a cancan dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The Girl in no mans land is OK even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is % unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed like shes on Valium. But what really kills this illconceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie shes no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough even if Julie plays a German spy she still comes across as cloying and cute.How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after  years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.\n","neg: 0.122, neu: 0.741, pos: 0.137, compound: 0.9771, \n","This series made for Televisión Española (TVE) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in  primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.Based on a background of historical events such as the May  student uprising in France the decaying Franco regime the war in VietNam the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.Generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times as it should be stated anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.The best thing that can be said of this series is Ana Duatos rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well manifesting that peculiar Spanish penchant especially noticeable among women of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the ain.

Indeed as an actor he should not be trusted in anything which is not a TV series. His resources are too limited; however his part as father of the workingclass household is not at all bad.Not really recommendable for other audiences even Spanishspeakers in Latin America: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary Spanish history such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references.

Actually he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donners hated ex then tells the professor its his turn to kill Mrs. Lift swapping murders as seen in Hitchcocks Strangers On A Train.As a director DeVito not only complements his actors performances with scenesetting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes (and away from taking things too seriously.)Also helping matters is writer Stu Silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter. You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here. Shes not a woman...Shes the Terminator. One little murder and Im Jack the Ripper. Those are all Crystals words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are DeVitos and Ramseys. Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the IMDb and thats a shame because he had real talent for it.The best scene in this movie when Crystal meets Ramsey was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time Ive seen a movie promoted that way. Owen introduces the professor to his mother as Cousin Patty and when Momma says he doesnt have a Cousin Patty panicky Owen loses it. You lied to me he yells out slamming the professors forehead with a pan.Of course in reality the professor wouldnt groan out something witty from the floor but Throw Momma From The Train works effectively at such moments when playing its Looney Tunes vibe for all its worth. DeVito hasnt disappeared from films of course but its a mystery why he hasnt really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie. Maybe its because as Throw Momma From The Trains lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isnt to everyones tastes. Thats too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it.\n","neg: 0.118, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.136, compound: 0.567, \n","A Compelling Thriller!!

Instead we have a group of selfobsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits Im suprised it hasnt been banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well.

A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas Good Time Charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician) Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone. Its Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as Charlies Angels.When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is a classic You can teach em to type but you cant teach em to grow tits. No argument there.But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the Russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance huh?Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin CHARLIE WILSONS WAR is a sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behindthe scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising Charlies Team.The onscreen Team is composed of three marvelous actors with four () Academy Awards and nine () nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. Hes aided abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring a wealthy Houston socialite played by the stillslinky Julia Roberts. Hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know  but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the Team Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos a smart street wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score  both in the Agencys boardroom and in Wilsons bedroom.For the Mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money lots of money and eventually Charlies Team covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $ billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes topoftheline stateoftheart antiaircraft and antitank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty nasty stuff.That this kind of multibillion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the businessasusual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma I wish it werent so...Even though the initial outcome for Team Charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes once the Russkies left so did our aid  zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster  its like the forerunner to Mission Accomplished.As Nichols film so pointedly points out The ball youve set in motion can keep bouncing even after youve lost interest in it. Mike Krzyzewski knows this Eva Longoria Parker knows this little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this but the typical American politician doesnt. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldnt let the world know we were the good guys.

Bunuel had a lifelong grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what youd expect from a smartaleck yearold in film class. The last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nosethumbing at religion.If you read the scholars regarding this slowpaced occasionally amusing film its all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty ute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the churchs fault (for interrupting his lovemaking) or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.There are a few moments where you might cry Aha! surrealism!: a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model) a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in B/W). The rest is forgettable selfindulgence. Unfortunately Bunuel was still chasing the same bogeymen through the rest of his career (Viridiana Discreet Charm...).

The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. Also the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All of this so far is accurate. But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also youd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against it.This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and selfhate. There may be some truth to that but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.Plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only  hourlong episodes.

Here the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costellos Whos on next routine. As a long term Daffy fan I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous Pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer as always is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions.

Disturbing? Hilarious? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire. From wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout.Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie youre about to watch. Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets peoples attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt. Meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about  feet behind them. He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre HALT! and then promptly wastes the mother. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.So now we fast forward about  years ( if youre honest about the heros age) to beautiful Turkey where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something. Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while Bo (masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They dont seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together. That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame youre my sister he says to her while shes stark naked make for a very dynamic duo. Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love.So anyway theres a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plotlines Fred the hammer Williamson (for some reason) and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). All of these things are great but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire. You may be glad you did..or not.\n","neg: 0.098, neu: 0.697, pos: 0.206, compound: 0.9966, \n","I am so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy.

Woody Ive seen these characters already Ive seen the storyline from you ten times already. Where did your creativity go??? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall  and you need to change along with it.There are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your and of angst and neuroticism  why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out it does nothing for me  because now Ive come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating.

As a Don Knotts vehicle The Incredible Mr. Limpet was much better with Knotts character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. His performance there was toned down with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile much as Bob Denver did. Neither really seemed to be able to eak out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast. It was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the highpitched voice. John Ritter whom Knotts worked with in Threes Company was able to transcend his genre anching out successfully into dramatic roles like The Dreamer of Oz but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in Pleasantville. Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in Airplane! and Police Squad.Theres also no way the then yearold Knotts could pass for a  yearold as his character insisted he was. It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at  playing the collegeage Forrest Gump.The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget very much looking like a hastilyfilmed TV episode. Its especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where Roy goes after hes fired. Its unlikely even a preschooler would be fooled by the Mayberrylike soundstage artificiality.Even viewing this strictly as a childrens movie its very disappointing. Its not because it lacks action or special effects although it does. The pace is much too slow the situations repetitive. How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap with eakneck gags otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). Movies even kids movies have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. Disneys The Love Bug for instance at least had some interesting race action.\n","neg: 0.096, neu: 0.778, pos: 0.125, compound: 0.9079, \n","If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called Outlaw Seas or The Outlaw Sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One many of the worlds freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and its difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners dont have an office in a real country. Two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three there is often a language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway its fascinating reading.Horrifying story excellent movie.

I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I cant risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed.

But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.Redas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj. However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He cant drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his sons protest to get him there in their oken down vehicle.But Reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand. And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals.The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences.Its perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are.

So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links  but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) Im sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock wasnt too bad  but hes no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the  minor  Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! Theres no such thing as a  minor  Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design theyre as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress  Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor  Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of Americas greatest living character actors Best Actor  Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress  Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director  Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because hed never won one . Actually Im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for TAXI DRIVER  RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didnt deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film  MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDBs controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past  I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake !

As the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the book.Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the General a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter Carmilla for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Lauras condition and the General?I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but I cant be bothered with that. Its called the this movie doesnt make any sense game.All you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete.It will have to answer such questions as ... * Why can vampires walk around in day light?* Why are they all lesbians?* Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself?* When is the movie a dream and when is it real?* Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelid?* Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie too?* And why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car?* And then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car?What the hell is the asylum scene all about?* What the hell is the green goo all about?* Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse?* Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies?* What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?In fact sod it its just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.I have my plot and I have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effort.In ConclusionVampires vs Zombies has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies.

Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy.

Do not get me wrong some people can MAKE that funny Dani Levy cant not for me anyway.The main problem I have with this movie is that I cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two others one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing  just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better.The acting is not bad Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler.

Its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books with you know Fahrenheit  and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances with a great cast like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that it has PAM GRIER!How could it fail?There may be spoilers within.First of all it was dumbed down. Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book...gone. Everything that made you squirm...gone.And then theres the acting. Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the s the kids in this movie cannot act. And this bugged me a lot neither of them looked  but  or . Their strong friendship wasnt addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. Youd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here its like they just dont care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. Pam Grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasnt well pulled off. Shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence as she did in the book.

Having reserved a special slot for it last night I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged  and a Film Studies student) with chocolates of course in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent we viewed on.Anne played by Sally Hawkins looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions eaking our hardwon fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost Ill find you stalking fashion.Poor Rupert PenryJones who played Captain Wentworth did his best with the script and direction bless him. I hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably eached the seawall drenching him and his coactor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a reshoot of this scene. Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.Other than Mr. PenryJones Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Heads unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.Towards the longawaited end of the film Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. In contrast Anne ran hyperventilating from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up a sweat.We experienced none of Annes charms crossing the screen. Indeed we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain spineless opinionless Anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.The crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment was painfully drawn out. As they moved in closer Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of Englands finest scenery.Sorry Jane.\n","neg: 0.087, neu: 0.817, pos: 0.096, compound: 0.1806, \n","If you like SciFi Monsters and Ancient Legends then you will love this movie!!

Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didnt read the book things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper.

Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early s in Disneys LaughOGram cartoon series; however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celeity Productions where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by  the studio was closed. Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color.s Skeleton Frolics is essentially a remake of the  classic The Skeleton Dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune. Like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune. Now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: its hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves.Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by The Skeleton Dance years before although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor. The ight tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film. For starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all.However it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way) but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for The Skeleton Dance. In other words while DeNats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while Stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music ings down Iwerks flawless work of animation. Personally I think that with a better musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remembered as fondly as The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundeaking as its still a fun film to watch.Its kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disneys main rival) he did not lack the quality of those companies films. It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney. Despite its shortcomings Skeleton Frolics is a very funny and visually eathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just cant help but thinking of The Skeleton Dance while watching it) it definitely reminds us that Iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us./\n","neg: 0.072, neu: 0.763, pos: 0.165, compound: 0.9975, \n","Yes indeed it could have been a good movie.

I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and tearyeyed at the end as I was. Im both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. The Graduate Easy Rider) now just seem silly and I dont want this to fall into the same category. But I will find it and if it turns out silly then at least Ill be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. When we met we went through this with Last Tango in Paris. The youngsters I work with (Im ) respect my opinions but its hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now. I just cant figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. Friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie. It will ing back a lot of special feelings Im sure.

Its like a riff on James M. Cains The Postman Always Rings Twice at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when hes not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to ing some goodies for Seki... and a little extra. Theyre soon sleeping together but after he does something to her (lets just say a shave) he knows that hell find out and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well. Naturally this will come back to haunt them  but that its literally at least to them (at first superterrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji) changes gears into the Kaidan a Japanese ghost story.This is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. In a way theres the mechanics of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a th century Japanese village as opposed to an American city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc). Its compelling because Seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but illprepared Toyoji and her reactions to Gisaburos reappearances are staggering to her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.While it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end theres so much here that director Oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses (which ironically got banned in his own country) he made something that he claimed was even *more* daring that Senses. Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range) but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. You can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two wouldbe lovebirds will go. The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake.And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the misenscene (i.e. the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after I finish typing this (i.e. Toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how Seikos nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). Its daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and deaths connections to one another inextricably. Its a classic waiting to be discovered.\n","neg: 0.127, neu: 0.791, pos: 0.083, compound: -0.9885, \n","I am not a big music video fan.

I would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon but here it is. Armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headacheinducing style (sorry I have no other words for it) Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to reevaluate an entire genre; that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better.Now not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles  nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Seen  I was under the impression that something didnt smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny wannabe hip quickcuts full of gory images and bombastic colors I knew where that smell was coming from.It turns out that two policemen or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver. A serial killer known as Monkey Killer (what a menacing chilling nickname uh?) for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people. You see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims. So far six eyes six ears and three tongues. In very ingenious fashion Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people... well because he probably wants to complete the number . So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien) a young successful goodlooking businessman with a dreadful temper. And thats where the ripoff of American Psycho kicks in.So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet. Along the way to that a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes in the back of the disco club because... well just because the script tells us its a suspect place; then with one single punch in the stomach Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again? Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic?Anyway after another murder Gerrick turns in as a witness but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct fashion Smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity.I wont spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment; there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a utal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly cant imagine how anyone could not laugh at it.At  minutes Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about one single character because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity./\n","neg: 0.204, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.082, compound: -0.9988, \n","The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction.

His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novaks apartment will leave you shaken.Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role.

First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the s to the s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character Lestat.

However / decades later its being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.As for the Stooges this is a film from there very early daysbefore MGM had any idea what to do with the team. At this point they were known as Ted Healy and his Stooges as Healy was the front man. Fortunately for the Stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man (read up on himyoull see what I mean) and the rest is history. Within a year they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton Laurel and Hardy Abbott and Costello and others). In fact up until they left for Columbia MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And oddly in this film they didnt act as a teamthey just did various supporting roles such as Larry playing the piano!This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle. When they are rescued and ought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there. As for Pearl I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug (but slightly less welcome). As for Durante I never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud and...loud! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keatons career to make this film. Together Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor(?) and Vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flat.In this film the Stooges they didnt yet have the right chemistry. Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd. What they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines. Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything Stoogeeven the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films (oh and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly).Overall the film is rather dull and disappointing. However there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess. At about the  minute mark you will see a ief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing. Look carefully as this is Walter Brennan in a role youd certainly never expect! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the Clean as a Whistle song starting at about  minutes into the film. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a socalled PreCode scene that never would have been allowed in films after  (when the Production Code was strengthened). Despite the word Clean in the title its a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything! Its quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early s. Finally at the  minute mark see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades. See the film youll see that I mean!\n","neg: 0.073, neu: 0.83, pos: 0.097, compound: 0.8643, \n","When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking into her others death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes.

He certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew.

Theres more than a oad hint that theres a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke. Hes not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke all pretty rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didnt do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided Steves performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen.

As a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of PreCode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put outeven if they arent married and even if their partner IS!! The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However Miss Dunne does NOT want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless (after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).Surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about / of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a womens prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And as a result of all this violence Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.But then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. Now throughout the film Dunne is portrayed as a very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). But now single Irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. Then in the final moments of the film Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends.So we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early s idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. A strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! With a decent rewrite this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull PreCode film.\n","neg: 0.124, neu: 0.762, pos: 0.114, compound: -0.876, \n","I caught this movie on the SciFi channel recently.

I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland and the only reason I agreed to go...was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D not much more then that.The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at Jack Blacks humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled Pick of Destiny. Again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said there were times it felt a bit long; its only  minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss they miss bad. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.I will say that the Rrating really saved this movie from bombing; The Ds humor simply couldnt work without cussing sex and drug references. But unless youre a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent.

The movie relies on the audiences knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it does so very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise itll be that much better.With that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe.I believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again for those who are familiar with the FF story and background the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation).Once again I myself having only played through FF once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized. Like a dance.In short if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy  this film will blow you out of the water. If youre in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as FF on Playstation or PC doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience.Finally I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film. Characters move with fluidity. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions subtle clues that ing about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves.Thanks Square Enix.

A better title for the film would be It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances. The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent.

We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bombers parents and her angry and closedminded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic in my mind to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative.

You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy who was desperate to control the young Queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her.

I read it with my th grade class and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot and doesnt explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it!

For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when its in the right hands that is  A Bugs Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalie film productions.It is only Pixars second animated feature. The subgroup of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in  with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention reinvented and eathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.After all its a film about ants. Well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bugs Life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However we forget that in Toy Story a bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter.Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isnt an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bugs Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley) and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful Ant Island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his antics.The problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands; however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.If you think about it A Bugs Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of Akira Kurosawas classic Seven Samurai or the American remake The Magnificent Seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bugs Life the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a barroom awl.Much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce) a sidesplitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). Its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen as is the entire movie collectively.As Ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bugs Life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kidfriendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like. However its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this film.Although A Bugs Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bugs Life other than: see it; its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at Emeryville California but this beats out the lot of its year  and Ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of ../\n","neg: 0.094, neu: 0.742, pos: 0.164, compound: 0.9982, \n","What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel.

The special effects were fantastic and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I cant even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. I have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Loiss  yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of Superman. When the crying superchild throws a piano at Lexs henchman to save his mother I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child. Its been  days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesnt take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out whats wrong with that. I dont know how many comic books Brian Singer has read but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Supermanrelated projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then ush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. Thats not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a Godlike Jorel sent to Earth to be a savior. Jorel wasnt allwise he was just a scientist. And he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. Ill buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christs primary weakness. Furthermore the crucifixion scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a ick until Im too aindead to notice the azenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie Superman Returns: the Passion of the Christ.And speaking of Luthor my last major complaint has to do with Singers depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns as well as all the previous Superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous Superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singers next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!To summarize I dont know what I hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you havent already. Dont see it dont buy it when it comes out on DVD dont rent it...basically dont contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact I think that for every person that sees this movie Bryan Singer should be fined  billion dollars. If youre a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and youll get the same experience without having to waste  hours of your time.\n","neg: 0.091, neu: 0.808, pos: 0.101, compound: 0.5717, \n","This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever.

The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The O.C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle.BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films/television shows which deal with the subjects I referenced I think you will find at least something here.In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way I especially liked how they explained where the Cylons belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays Lacy Rand. While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something I think needs work. I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident.Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where Caprica goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did.\n","neg: 0.102, neu: 0.799, pos: 0.099, compound: -0.8169, \n","Im the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season from the b grade to the Hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasnt to good compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz (quite good) and IceT in new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (IceT) kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both IceT and the other dude this kills the Jamaican however IceT is unharmed very similar to Ices other movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) were Snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon.

And there was no mutated monkeylike creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot... : There is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft carrier no communications stations on huge cliffs LITTLE reference to any ingame contents (characters/items/vehicles) in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. : The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. : Theres an Ending scene... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after...

There are certain films (works of art like this film Dark City and Breaking the Waves) that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend...

It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly  it changed our world.However I cant not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry I am at the careless blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid wordofmouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the lowdown bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the ave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post world?!?!?! How...dare...they? To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones.

Thats why movies like Fast and the Furious Dhoom Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones. We live on a tiny island and I cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with % tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the sea.And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long cant compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame) however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.So there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage as does the GT. Here the Ford GT takes on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even Im impressed alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos Porshe Carerra GTs Koenigsegg CCXs and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time theyre mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they canTheres no story in Redline just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator mind you tapping the ake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect) steering wheels gear shifts (always shifting up and not down) all these while having the actors make pretend that theyre the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.The heroine (yes it made a statement that girls can drive) Natasha (a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds  a girl with model looks who dont mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts luicants and going for rides). Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous (Eddie Griffin) she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else well like I said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.And its almost always the same as theres very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker Sun Kang and of course the star it created  Vin Diesel Redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where its one man one car and a  minutes race against time to get to Vegas.If not for the cars then this movie seriously is a piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action.

Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his Mustang which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on when McQueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. That shot of McQueens Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickmans rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. Hickmans look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then of course San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. Also Bullitt being filmed in the s when cars were still Hot (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden Pontiacs in the s Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Seven ups had a few jumps over little hills (Yawn) but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity.

Obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably Dawn of the Dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than ains.Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outeak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a $ to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgunwielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming I dont have any change!! Unfortunately the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change.The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately homeless people eak into the mans house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks ago.Meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the mans head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out Randy pulls the trigger.In Evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica California.The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely rewatchable. /\n","neg: 0.101, neu: 0.818, pos: 0.082, compound: -0.9013, \n","Im not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is NOT a horror movie.

The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesnt make it true. Customs change word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same its always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one Ive found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces without punctuation without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a Lexicon to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic Greek or Heew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. Its also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesnt exist!

This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate  which bypasses the Ocean View area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile in the past few years the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a soughtafter location for construction of highend housing.It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster. This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Park.As to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for Bgrade movies of the time. With the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I dont believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new nonnude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; lets come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!.For the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk the first Harborfest and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome.\n","neg: 0.068, neu: 0.838, pos: 0.094, compound: 0.876, \n","I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachans role of SARKAR but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Vermas direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things.

He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage making the last line of Kiplings poem ring true. He is unforgettable.Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru.

I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Dont get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fetts name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yodas death.. Well nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wans death okay but Yodas not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset. Lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo Chewbacca and the Princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that the heroes  of course always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not  heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Dont believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Landos base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete. By Annakins revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact thats is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Lukes father...Isnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?On another note I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind I always try to go into a film with the attitude that Well it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Lets see. That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.I am not sure who criticizes these movies but I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its  minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above. For example the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!Finally I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details (or see it as just another sequel) to trash the movie such as This movie stinks because Luke is not in it! then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.\n","neg: 0.15, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.142, compound: -0.9706, \n","Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned Gentlemans Agreement which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying Its because Im Jewish isnt it? Its much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully the ief featurette on the Warners DVD doesnt mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an antiSemitic one but its interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish theres little doubt in Sam Levenes performance that the character is in fact also gay  not a mincing caricature but theres definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with George Coopers confused soldier. Theres not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.Theres an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry) but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set over one long sweltering night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laidback but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum Robert Youngs Maigretlike detective Gloria Grahames tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryans excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. A big surprise hit in  as a reward Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews.

Its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad Russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.Its interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the villains. In this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who youre fighting against. At first its kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the Germans are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them.The way this story is told isnt however the best. Its hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isnt always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesnt always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasnt even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I dont know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that theyre being played by well cast actors. All of the actors arent the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values./\n","neg: 0.111, neu: 0.723, pos: 0.166, compound: 0.9864, \n","So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Eberts book I hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one a rare zerostar rating in the book and said at the end of his original review Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor. So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Eberts review of Rob Reiners North where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a illiant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I dont think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this movie I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfusss girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first  or  minutes the other  minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for  seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatras My Way sang by Gaiel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that Independence Day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that Independence Day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if Independence Day were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of Mad Dog Time says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted  minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of  minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of Mad Dog Time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire.

After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie Gwoemul (aka The Host) of  which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a Bmovie genre successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic.

Remember Dungeons & Dragons in ? Hasnt anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.In short I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem Arirang being played at the very end.

Still Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children.That said I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move enthralled a  year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the star power of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus a  year old (my nephew Aaron) whos review was of course it was good! Everything Miyazakisan does is good! a  year old animation fan ought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er that would be me) and a  year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and Im betting the older charas too) and loving the cuteness of the child characters.And that is what I respect most about Miyazakisan. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface Ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there a little boy names Soske (somewhat like The Little Mermaid) but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyos Mother Soskes mother the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. Once human she teams up with her friend Soske whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. Hes related to the Jonas others. Can we just get past that please?) gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics youre not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.In the end Ponyos father Fujimoto must cope with his daughters decision and his estranges wifes wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will remember him fondly. And once again Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy. Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a bad person. All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. And then theres the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was handdrawn and I for one was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like and what it SHOULD look like. In the end I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazakis best (in my opinion that honor is still held by Kikis Delivery Service) but still a star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.\n","neg: 0.042, neu: 0.743, pos: 0.215, compound: 0.9995, \n","Attractive Marjorie(Farrah Fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker.

Almost all recent box office figures are false  because they fail to adjust inflation. Obviously todays $ movies will dominate. In  it cost c to $. at Radio City; c to c first run at Loews Palace in Washington DC or c to c in neighborhood runs. What counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin. The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead % of the movies focus was on the music. Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the bestever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE Edmund Purdom took his place  with Lanzas voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and notfat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO its almost always on eBay for $. or less.

While the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment. The specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowing...I havent seen such angry seas since The Perfect Storm. Costar Clancy Brown (HBOs Carnivale  great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guards Kodiak Alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins.

Her aunt (Edna May Olivera person too talented for this film) didnt like Wheelera sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady aoad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywoodthe silent era through the s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey) I cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brothers film DUCK SOUP yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. In fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routineso prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.Once again I have found yet another subpar film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERSwhich I actually gave s to on IMDb) this one was a major endurance test to completesomething that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey.

All of the jokes are obvious  the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame  and they are not given any new treatment or twist.

This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacaa that kills all the local villagers in the little town of Furlough in Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. And I guess it actually works because thats the reason why I bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid. Anyway the movie isnt any good. Actually its bloody awful. But I didnt expect anything else when I bought it. Its a low budget horror movie with a Chupacaa monster. If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaad.This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. Its so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. Its like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. Shes the worst of them all. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (And Ive seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies she cant stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her.Some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. The ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacaa strikes and the lighting is way too dark. The gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty hilarious really but thats the way I like it. The Chupacaa looks pretty messed up and its easy to see that its a guy in suit.Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and its very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death.

Women are a mere sideshow in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a freethinking independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. The skiing sequences are fine with some good stuntwork involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus Im not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel I couldnt really be that excited for him one way or another.Of the actors Redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way hes doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.In truth though theres a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the leading characters.

He dreams of playing in his products TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for  years with no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies. But this is what he says; we actually dont see him suffer that much: he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town. Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to oadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.In a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. In search of his stolen bike Ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously. Annoyed by the nagging of his wife Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. One of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. According to him Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. When he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Alis bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.Although the plot may look promising in a way its the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. First the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies. We dont see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorbike is found it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism of globalism.Second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy. Maybe Im wrong maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars or to have a political message! If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a mans big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying f**k you then you may find this film funny.\n","neg: 0.141, neu: 0.724, pos: 0.136, compound: -0.9112, \n","Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so I am happy to see any of their films.

I because of my s style early Childhood watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too.It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville Simon Seville Theodore Seville and David Seville. David the Chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. While they are talking Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world (Even though technically Dave is only going to Europe so to Alvin apparently only America and Europe qualify as The World). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. Later at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of Around the World in  days against the Chipettes(Brittany Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile Alvin gets in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to varify that they were there. The winning team would then receive a . dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the Kickass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. Its also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include Getting Lucky(Kind of Suggestive for a kids film eh?) and My Mother as well as Wooly Bully and Off to see the world Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with My mother still ings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song Getting Lucky I first didnt think anything of it but when I grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Princes men when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway A bit after that scene the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince a very small but important role. The ending is of course a happy one. The Crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset Alvin complaining about not having gotten his . dollar reward for winning the race which annoys Dave until he finally yells ALVIN! and the screen fades to blackClassic ending by the way.

Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall winning Oscars for both) is splendid. Working with Madden the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.Madden does an excellent job of inging us the Italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film. There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isnt much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abeviated. While the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal. Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When fight he must Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.Penelope Cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia. In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. She allows the character to be objectified as Corellis love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine. However Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagias fiancé.I rated this film an /. Despite some drawbacks this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.

Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to ing about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.Its really rather messy though. Fellowes doesnt seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seatedged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.The dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichélandmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score cant create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. Theres also a very prosaic dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didnt want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.Finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this metaessay with good performances and John Warnabys ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the owfurrowing.Im disappointed; not that its bad but that it could have been much better. /\n","neg: 0.056, neu: 0.869, pos: 0.075, compound: 0.664, \n","This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched.

Dont get the wrong idea I dont mean to bad mouth Disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and THATS OKAY. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. But not with Holes. Its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny. Really its the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to.Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge.

When the old (and better) tech TV had to hit the icks the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. Attack of the Show is the replacement for the Screen Savers with  cohosts in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran came to be something of a cohost as well but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didnt pan out for some reason.Eventually (I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey this is what I read) the two got married. That was a big secret to me! Now there is a new female cohost the notashot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. Shes hiding something in those tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasnt afraid to show it.AHEM! Sorry.Attack of the Show deals with everything young people want to know about. Its music movies comic books the internet and television. This is whats great about the show. If you dont want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV you can get all you want on AOTS. Some segments and bits they do are funny.

In their apartments we see that theres never any dad around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school.

It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally oadcast in  and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a Jane Eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently reread the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the Rivers family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the Gypsy scene done correctly.The casting is perfect Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book small plain and dark and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre  you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!\n","neg: 0.05, neu: 0.759, pos: 0.191, compound: 0.9977, \n","In a time of bad if not plain awful comedies King of Queens is more than just a eath of fresh air its a complete oxygen tank!

Warrens followup to SATANS SLAVE () amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Brownes eyecatching cinematography) though Annans discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doeeyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and left under mysterious circumstances. Stokes unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. Theres an extraordinary multilayered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to emasculate their clueless visitor by dressing him in womens clothing though Stokes alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.In the early scenes at least the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowdpleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (quite literally) gutwrenching especially Annans final scene which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in  and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid so ace yourselves!). Excellent performances by the three leads bolstered by Warrens unobtrusive direction which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations thereby compensating for the films budgetary shortcomings.

Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick) a former paratrooper in the British Army is the local dentist hes not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion not maliciously but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. The islands serenity is oken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a utally slain woman. He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp Inskip(Maurice Roëves) at the islands police station Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP Dr Goudry for closer inspection. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless as does a search for a missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson a woman from the mainland who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. With a heavy fog rolling in the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help the radio also doesnt work seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports of UFOs and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikins idea that aliens might be involved but a rise in radioactive levels on the island has him doubting himself.The Nightmare Man is based on the novel Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blakes  scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. The Nightmare Man though is on the whole a succinctly better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background. The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over but its one that I enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to Camfield he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. There is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point. If there is one negative about the killer its that we are given his/her/its POV for the killings an acceptable cliché on its own but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but its a fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. Imrie never one ive taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production. The outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers it disappointed me in some ways but taking into account when it was made its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it is even more terrifying.\n","neg: 0.111, neu: 0.795, pos: 0.095, compound: -0.9608, \n","This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie  so if you havent seen either movie and want to but dont want the spoilers please dont read this review!While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions.

I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its Sita character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta not her direction. The characters big and small were welldeveloped and seemed quixotic towards the endsomewhat like the end of Mazurskys An Unmarried Woman. They are ave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of himcarrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be illiant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese microminority in the social milieu of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mrinal Sen Adoor Gopalakrishnan Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giantsgiven her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehtas film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middleclass household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middleclass homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada Malayalam and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers.Ms Das Ms Azmi Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sens Khandar Gautam Ghoses Paar Benegals Ankur) a illiance notably absent in this film. Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. All in all the films strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema.

A defining point to Elephant was its ethereal ambiance. With spare conversation little development of characters and the long tracking shots Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread.

I wont watch it again so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie Im sure it will set a record.Some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxtons character has hijacked Hamills prisoner an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question though is why didnt he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman.If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense then I suppose youll find something of interest here. But you cant convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxtons character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks theres some hidden meaning here youre really stretching.Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming The End to come into view alas even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder then so is understanding; this movie had neither. Yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run  an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons.

Although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly sunny Jack Haley stars as Joe Jenkins a young Kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to Hollywood where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves starstruck Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick who prefers using the entire MGM studio as his set does so here as Cecilia always ready for an audition is treated by a wouldbe paramour cinema star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer) to behindthescenes action of naturally a musical comedy featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes including their wellknown skit involving a tiny harmonica and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On balance one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star a role which he largely creates and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeleys filmic spectacles.\n","neg: 0.014, neu: 0.775, pos: 0.21, compound: 0.9901, \n","The jokes are obvious the gags are corny and the characters are walking characatures  but I couldnt stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie.

There was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have been. If so it would have placed the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt a hint of depth or charisma  not a trace  in any one character performer or portrayal.The principals handling of Lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump attacking Jennys boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentallychallenged).The smarmy unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession.Finally (and frankly I rather enjoyed this part) the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that youd rather depend upon Barney Fife without Andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most reallike cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the Law and Order series and the like  but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on Lifetime.Finally I found a kind of story within a story fascination with Joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement like going from F to Fminus.This whole lame situation should have been resolved  in real life  in about  minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hours blank film in the camera. But the writer(s) here proved with their ending they could do even worse. When the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about  seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.This ones a * presentation; the second * because it does have some mild fascination.\n","neg: 0.11, neu: 0.785, pos: 0.105, compound: -0.6734, \n","If you havent seen this yet you really should on DVD.

Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to eak into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin wont like her because shes ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeanes character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as standup comedienne and archfeminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is antifeminist when in fact its just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. Its interesting to note her hypocrisy too. Shed been a feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heavens sake! What this film was really was antimen if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose ains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurmans character Noelle.There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplins character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey theyve never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. Theres also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isnt ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? Shes certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: shes lanky and gaunt looking.I guarantee three things about this film if youve never watched it:You will know what the ending will be;You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;You will be bored after ten minutes.Watch at your own peril.\n","neg: 0.12, neu: 0.739, pos: 0.14, compound: 0.916, \n","This movie has everything typical horror movies lack.

Yet at the heart of it all each character maintains a streak of decency  moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life. How true these words are. Watsons Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue  shes the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend ones professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply dont want to face the consequence; one ironically cant believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue  fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor decency and heart remain strong. The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. Its not sensational or complex as another film Where the Truth Lies . Credits due to Fellowes writing and the nuanced performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all human frailty not excluded they meant well. And following along with the story the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Mannings seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. You might say theres no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in Separate Lies yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention.

Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( And no thats not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who cant read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them . This is what I dont get  Even though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising theyre charging towards a gaping ravine !

I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allens work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoops most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johansons character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johansons performance but I am a bit bias I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allens stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johansons character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detectivelike than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor laugh and be merry.Needless to say if you enjoy Allens work watch it. If not watch something else...\n","neg: 0.078, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.161, compound: 0.9888, \n","I rented this film because of my interest in American history and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his vision into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosenhowever a miracle occurs which cements his place in history.I found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.Im sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subjectmatter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.\n","neg: 0.041, neu: 0.845, pos: 0.114, compound: 0.9546, \n","s Frightmare is an odd little film. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic s/s style horror movies with the shock factor of the thenexploding s slasher genre. It isnt totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the lessthanprofessional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named Conrad Ratzoff. At the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star as hes shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol Conrad is a bit of a hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff. Just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Deaths door he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrads grave an after hours visit eaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrads body seated in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime Mrs. Ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husbands body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life its not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he reawakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying Hello? Is anyone there? are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semiintelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again were in an s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrads body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder moans and groans howls etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.I cant really recommend Frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the s. Modern Horror fans will doubtlessly find Frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from Frightmare. Fans of Jeffrey (ReAnimator) Combs may also want to check it out as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Wards Vault of Horror and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. Im told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma which seems appropriate. If youre a Troma kind of person then Frightmare will be right up your alley.\n","neg: 0.162, neu: 0.766, pos: 0.072, compound: -0.998, \n","People watch movies for a variety of different reasons.

That movie is great because the plot isnt stale and recycled. Its basic yeah  a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But its real dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real the situations are far more real. Tommy Boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters  we feel nothing for them and we dont care about whats happening onscreen.

Some compare it to Shakespeares Tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its The Tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? Underneath this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek.Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. If it were not for the goofy retroartdeconess of s scifi props you might think you were watching a s piece.This is a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi I like to call s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effects. The clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek Lost in Space and even Farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Treks original series aired about  years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it.

Ms Francis Earl Holliman and the amazing Robby the Robot are the standout actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job.

There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. But when I read the reviews already written on this title I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes dont know what to criticize. Therefore to be clear Ill divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about Visconti before his directors career and latter one about Visconti the director. The aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. His effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino was ought up as a real count of Milano: in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For instance his fathers splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. There is also an emphasis on Viscontis crucial visit in Paris in the s where he met eminent people (left wingers) who later had impact on his style and message in art. That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upinging (a contrast at first sight). However the part about his directors career which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the directors death in  is poorly executed. His movies are not discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli the director remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later such movies like IL GATTOPARDO LA CADUTA DEI REI LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig I did not like the interviews of his. Moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... There is no mention of significant works of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE there are no interviews with eminent cast Burt Lancaster. A mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made. There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. Franco Zeffirelli though I appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. For instance he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. Therefore I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. What I find a strong point here are footage interviews with Visconti himself. As a result we may get his own opinion about his works. For instance I very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG.I believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI () by Carlo Lizzani than this doc. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director. Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned peoples emotions and viewpoints into stone... /\n","neg: 0.095, neu: 0.768, pos: 0.137, compound: 0.9886, \n","Time is precious.

He creates an aggressive antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothush moustache. Sound like anyone you know?From the safety of Hollywood Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in  had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to emoil itself in Europes civil strife (remember it was Hitler who declared war on the USA not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly humane ave etc. etc Chaplin is Hynkel and he also plays The Jewish Barber the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say Chaplin writes directs stars composes the music and does the catering.In  the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All this does is to humanise him. When Hynkel the notverywarlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upsidedown aeroplane he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As dictator he inspects his subordinates technical innovations which dont work (the parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the reallife Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact Hynkels regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.In truth Chaplins day had already passed when he made this illconsidered polemic. At heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour with gags like staggering up and down the street semiconscious or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrers face your cause is doomed to failure because its built upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people? And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of AuschwitzBirkenau or Treblinka but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. As usual Chaplin thinks in terms of silent comedy setpieces loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave defiant resourceful hardworking and (of course) beautiful she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. Gee aint I cute? she asks after the Barber gives her a makeover. Too cute by far is the answer. She doesnt come close to ringing true because Chaplin has made her a caricature. The wouldnt it be wonderful? speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author  too wordy too emotionally cloying.Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He ings a whiff of muchneeded comic io to the proceedings but the films underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective how can we fear him? And anyway the stuttering stopstart of the backprojected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?\n","neg: 0.121, neu: 0.743, pos: 0.136, compound: 0.9008, \n","Milo is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.Do we really need more slashers?I for one think we already have more than enough.I guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid thats also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.A long time agohe drowned but that didnt bother him and he still kills people(Friday the thwhats that?).One dayhis survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twistMilo comes to pay them a visit.Through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milos dullI mean dark secret.She and her friends have been dying to know.Once discoveredMilo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isnt it his bedtime yet?) and the girlwell she screams a lot.The acting is not even bottom of the barrelthe barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him thatbut some movies just cant be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.\n","neg: 0.201, neu: 0.749, pos: 0.05, compound: -0.9891, \n","This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL THRILLS AND yes a lot of GORE!!

For example while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the s at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the unt of the blame. Inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensued and the subsequent reversal of prohibition is totally ignored by this program.This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally prohibit whose users it has decided to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it. None of that is in here.On the other hand this is hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drugs in th century United States like marijuana LSD heroin cocaine MDMA and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. The criminal justice system along with its often harsh liferuining penalties is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs a lack of compassion for fellow humans a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. Its morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores it.So in sum the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives its pretty disappointing.\n","neg: 0.155, neu: 0.695, pos: 0.15, compound: -0.0557, \n","Considering this film was released  years before I was born I dont feel too bad for overlooking it for such a long time.

G. Wells great novel War of the Worlds. This is perhaps the least wellknown and very probably the best of them. No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the th Century   using Wells original setting in and near Woking England.IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers. That might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly. I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature so lets get right to the chase. The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease against which they have no immunity. If thats a spoiler so be it; after a book and  other films (including the  classic) you ought to know how this ends.This film which follows Wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late th/early th Century photography. Although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). Colors are often reminiscent of handtinting. At other times colors are washed out. These variations are typical of early films which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  as youll see on occasion here. The special effects are deliberately retrograde of a sort seen even as late as the s  and yet the Martians and their machines are very much as Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel. Some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of Big Ben. The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. Some aspects of Victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or illiantine on head and facial hair.This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells original narrative  as has been noted. Viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. Wells description of the Martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed. When the Martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how Wells described them. Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural England  plus a few scenes in London (involving the Narrators other). The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (Big Ben) but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of London.The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. The Narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what Wells terms the rout of Mankind. He encounters a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest where they discover an awful fact: the Martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. Wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting. The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the Martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; British curates are so often utterly insufferable).This film lasts almost  hours going through Wells story in welcome detail. Its about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. A word about the acting: Dont expect awardwinning performances. Theyre not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you. Most of them however have had very abeviated film careers often only in this film. The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana in his nd film. The Curate is John Kaufman  also in his nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. The Brother (Henderson) is played with some conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film. The Artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by James Lathrop in his first film.This is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it. Despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hypedup competitors. If you want to see H. G. Wells War of the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!\n","neg: 0.07, neu: 0.768, pos: 0.163, compound: 0.9982, \n","Of the elements that make this the best at this point I have to say # is Christine McIntire.

Any way I havent seen anything like this before so it was crazy! Of course thats a good thing. It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! Like chicken little the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying Twas beauty who killed the beast War of the worlds scene and more. Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one. Also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. However some parts dont fit. Like in the original lion king werent Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar? In this movie they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. Thers more the reason being why Pumbaa isnt so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also its just Timon Timon Timon.

Im sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn both of whom were great actors.The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. Whats that cliché? Marry in haste repent at leisure... In short the story is a series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with Johns livein mother their struggles to pay the bills Johns diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother) the couples angst about their marriage the babys sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to ing a special serum to save the child and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.How many more clichéd situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There wasnt much comedy; the drama was lacklustre at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate.This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.So it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun American values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative  all against the backdrop of the average American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? And it should be noted that the film was released in early ; so it was planned in   soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence this sort of film was a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many here would know Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the war.However Im glad I saw it  as a piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda. But Ill have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that youve seen all of Stewarts movies; otherwise dont bother.\n","neg: 0.069, neu: 0.827, pos: 0.104, compound: 0.9626, \n","Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that theres nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B.

One lone survivor attempting to rekindle his sanity takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and eaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan a man of the book is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking he is alone he begins living life his way  until Jeri Ryan appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate dystopia they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer  Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn confusion sets in a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. ainless jock. Even with nobody left on the planet it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.Using a variable film technique Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled The Quiet Earth (which I will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. With a borrowed story I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film directors techniques to attempt to find his own. He opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers. Sure the final days have arrived but could there be a concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived. A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. The juxtaposition would have been like Shawn of the Dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching a madeforTV program. Listening to the audio commentary I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt as happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this does make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feels cheap and in Ralstons case it was the latter.I must admit David Arnotts portrayal of Alan hooked me. He played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well. He was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together alas I cannot say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomerys first film and it was obvious  I mean  really really obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the culmination of the entire piece of art. She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. Confused? Again she fell into her character by the end giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. Even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment. While her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. This was her first film so can I be too harsh? Overall this film felt like it was missing something. I though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director his techniques are flawed and preused but he does know how to make a lowbudget comedy. I think our idea of funny is different so that is why I couldnt find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical. His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average. His film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?) which overall harmed the intensity of the film. This was a comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money  the was in essence the bank for The Last Man. Dont get your hopes up for any classic Avery moments.Dont expect more from Ralston  and that is how I will end it.Grade: ** out of *****\n","neg: 0.115, neu: 0.749, pos: 0.135, compound: 0.9756, \n","I must admit I was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of Cut last night though was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem.

I am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.And of course there was the gore.The use of the customised garden shears was illiance  besides the expected stabs and slashes. In short there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film  both performances were fantastic as well as Simon Bossell (The Castle) in a illiant role as the jokey technician.All in all I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as a beautiful satire/parody  toungueincheek till the very end.Loved it.

I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. Tom Savini Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The revolutionized makeup effects in the s. Today you dont need them as everything is done on computer. But computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. But I digress.Watching fantastically gory films like Fulcis Gates to Hell or even Savinis crowning achievement Friday the th the Final Chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. You cant tell the difference between reality and magic.I cant imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. If that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath. You dont see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwords.The gore? Well its here but not as much as one would hope or expect. A man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her easts but other then those two scenes and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. The scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. Maybe its just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but I was expecting a bit more. Call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? I honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe.

Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnans straight man.

It is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic wellacted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. I didnt know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of s softcore peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South. But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women  a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted none  none  of the characters are likable by the films end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin(youll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it) a girl at a school for manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War  particularly in the South. Soon Page teacher Elizabeth Hartman lovely young seductress Carol and even Ferdin(Amy)have emotional/sexual ties to Eastwood  each having their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. The Beguiled for me is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This might be(except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegels best film. It certainly is one of Eastwoods best REAL performances. page is always so very good and Hartman Ferdin et al excellent. the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic.

This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget  it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for . The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and firstrate. We get hawkmen shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigrons(oh my!)and many many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and firstrate special effects? No way. But for  most are very impressive. The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are wellwritten lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymonds phenom comic strip. Lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial. All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents  here most everyone has some ability. Dont get me wrong this isnt a Shakespeare troupe by any means but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike likable job as Flash. He is ably aided by Jean Arden Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts Crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us Professor Zarkov((Frank Shannon)) wears are about as formfitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious sardonic merciless and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack Tiny Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous rousing hilarious  a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. Lipson steals each and every scene he is in. The plot meanders here there and everywhere  but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow.

But if so director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he cant be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g. David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the faic of the story (e.g. Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenbergs later less bizarre works). In Pola X Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g. the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor particularly in the oftdiscussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.Not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrialtechno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhols Factory of the s?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. And even well into middleage Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has it. Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didnt sink into bathos.There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as Pola X more charitably. Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesnt work. But Carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movieviewing and literally thousands of films later I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe. At this early moment in the st century one is left asking: With the exception of JeanPierre Jeunet are there *any* directors in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore?

Of course I was seven at the time.Right before the Jackson movies came out my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.Because of budget constraints the movie  already a compression of The Fellowship of the Rings and part of The Two Towers  was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.Its not all bad though the animation ings a warmth to it that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later a halfhearted halfhour long TV special was aired which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a musical.\n","neg: 0.019, neu: 0.898, pos: 0.083, compound: 0.9377, \n","Just finished watching FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and its frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off  times. Yes we all get it that he a goodlooking guy with a nice body but I think most people knew this  years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman  times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldnt surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless......Enough about that lets get into his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didnt seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short I didnt like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great but that no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. Its insulting that they could take a great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. . Cool story that appeals to the male man . Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) . Al Pacino with  great speech scenes and  great one liners . Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan . Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School . Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal . Plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessaryThis will be good enough for most people but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MMI will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while emacing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing.

Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben illiantly. Hes definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film for me was Evies rather colourful poem.

Also wisely the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Annas father Chris and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest  transmuted to Johnny the Harp for films so as not to offend). This little change is interesting. Like too many films accused (by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldnt be more faithful to the property. By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldnt offend anyone or opening it up because they COULD too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. Fortunately the respect the studio had for both ONeill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marions generally sensitive screen adaptation. Wonder of wonders Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbos Anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! What the League of Decency must have thought of that! The source plays greatest problem has always been that Chriss friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage  the two sides of the genuinely good woman men dont always recognize. The perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbos Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only  minutes doesnt allow us too much time to miss her  one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original  AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from ONeill to ing Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Lavernes second act appearance in SHOW BOAT. Anna and Marthys early scene together on screen ( minutes into the film) taking each others measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. Not to be missed. ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. Its hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this  remake (it was first filmed without sound in   also with George Marions original Broadway Chris) could improve on this excellent filming. The internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldnt be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the New York harbor).Nearly all Garbos naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE  years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies) but this ANNA Christie together with the variety of her  films MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her  comedy NINOTCHKA (Garbo laughs!) surely stand as her best.ONeill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (). It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare nonWesterns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.\n","neg: 0.081, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.197, compound: 0.9983, \n","Let me set the scene.

He could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE he takes the latter approach and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney) much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and shes horribly burned in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen looking the worse for wear these days.) But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight and thats where the ECtheme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception. If anything the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And thats not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas and youre there.)Not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either.

It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesnt really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. Its still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless so it works for the movie.The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously overthetop as the nutty professor.The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed.

Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once theyre grown its easy to spot the writer/director among the four. Hes the quiet contemplative longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only theres no writing or directing talent on display here. And if you still cant figure out which one he is heres a hint: The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back kid like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme.

The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah thats the ticket.

It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw  sometimes erroneously referred to as the Streamline Dub (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc boxset.Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesnt have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original Japanese had and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations such as changing the main characters name from Pazu to Patzu and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music  the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disneys moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which I find annoying in many Disney films.This film still blows away most recent animated films and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Its true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whales pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better.The films final journey in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of Melvilles eerie manwhale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident. Its clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However it never goes there. The whalecharacter has no compassion or respect for anyone.The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jawslike where the seamonster finally kills everybody and Nolan and nodoubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whalehugger (tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier.)

I was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the end.Yes the plots been done (The Most Dangerous Game etc.) but I was hoping for and almost received the gotcha  how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. I think the hightech was overdone (GPSs) and gave me coldsweat flashbacks of Night Rider but it nevertheless was not too overdone.The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public idge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up? Pleeease. Way too much of that type of thing  fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very much.The final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy  except for Zane who doesnt get near as much work as he deserves IMHO  they were winners from a reality show.Knock me out.\n","neg: 0.082, neu: 0.812, pos: 0.106, compound: 0.6966, \n","I am a big fan of old horror movies and since I am middle aged old to me is a movie made before  with most being made in the s to s period. I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being Creepshow  which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com lol.

Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like The Flesh and the Fiends and From Beyond the Grave pairing up in a mids satanic themed exploitation flick. How can this possibly go wrong? Well unfortunately it can. To my deepest regret Land of the Minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote little area in Greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fireeathing Minotaur statue. Cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area Father Roch  the priest of a couple of towns before)  decides to investigate. Land of the Minotaur is a boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. Instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.\n","neg: 0.082, neu: 0.828, pos: 0.09, compound: 0.0141, \n","The three shorts included on this compilation issued in  are timeless Chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either.

The key word here is based. How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom.Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It. This involves him selling out and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. However they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidneys misadventures. The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid wellmeaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer. This contradiction is never that much of an issue because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects likability too well.Jeff Bridges underplays Sidneys editor a little too effectively and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidneys affections And with regard to Megan Fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet) I can say only this: just say the word Miss Fox and I will leave my wife sell all my belongings and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort. Of course given that Im a fat yearold English accountant you might not find my offer too enticing but its there on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become: however she does it sweetly with some skill and extremely sexily. This girl will go far.There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers  Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US.There are several laughoutloud moments and I smiled most of the way through.

Derivative doesnt even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease.

I mean if your going to have impossibly goodlooking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for oke.With about  seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a scifi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the th fame Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logans Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear.

She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. Its quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that lovemaking is about to begin. After the murders within her fantasies are committed Lorna awakens bewildered often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco Id say its elegant & difficult. By now youve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career as far as filmmaking style and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. And as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision others find the style labouring dull and bewildering. Ill be the first to admit that the film is over my head but even Franco himself when quizzed by critics who watched Succubus admitted that he didnt even understand the film and he directed it! Some might say that Succubus was merely a precursor to his more admired work Venus in Furs considered his masterwork by Francofaithful because it also adopts the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesnt truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. In a sense like the protagonist we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly Succubus is unconventional filmmaking where we arent given the keys to what is exactly going on. And a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesnt help matters. Succubus is also populated by beatnik types and poetspeak Cormans film A Bucket of Blood poked fun at. My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. Great locations and jazz score..I liked this film myself although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction.

For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then im afraid i dont know what the world has come to. Let me tell u something. I started watching many T.V shows like Lost Prison Break Dexter Deadwood and even Invasion. But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took  genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. Then we have The Sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes. There is no department that this show doesnt excel in. Acting Nothing short of superb. James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it wouldve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony. The raw emotion he displays is superb. Then we have everyone else Edie Falco Michael Imperioli Lorraine Bracco Dominic Chianese (whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part ) and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie Walnuts Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. Then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before. The story is nothing short of excellent. Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic.

Its got everything from hilarious humour to utal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. Not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God. I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it. Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V. After youve watched the first season youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.\n","neg: 0.103, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.165, compound: 0.9923, \n","Id give this a negative rating if I could.

Fox which paid Judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outeeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex which produces more stupid people. By  a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all faggy. Seriously is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time.

And you know what it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I dont take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations worst being Sittaford Mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had. Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general welldone script with Joan Hickson illiant as always as Miss Marple and solid turns from Liz Fraser Helen Cherry Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde.

(didnt make it past the first six episodes) The writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. The dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.The characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brotherinlaw (who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewers loyalty.Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldnt get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.Add to that I heard that Season Two wasnt as good so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.If youre a fan of good casting and writing I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course youre stoned and then all bets are off.\n","neg: 0.112, neu: 0.747, pos: 0.141, compound: 0.7183, \n","This movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. In Japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share? Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away.

It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits. That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history.The excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could.The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love.

Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey s. Its politics too upfront and ridiculous. And lets face it I was still under a lovespell known as BLOWUP : and I still havent completely shaken it. Now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well . . . Good Luck to me!But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is its own experienceand is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator the lategreat Mr. Antonioni.Twelve years ago I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size (immense) restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place.What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own.I remember the second time around seeing it  the early s  I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas before these two seemed like a smartalecky shadow version of Zefferellis Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet)they now were engaging me  particularly The Girl in her insistent slomotionality.

Undoubtedly ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment.

Dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hardcore Marine Raider. Geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of Vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincents character whose name is Marion takes Geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine Raider. Marion hitchhikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwelllike little town. In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine Raider could still be so innocent. The story also ings up the Japanese Internment Camps as the towns folks go hunting  escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But theres still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway this captures JMV at the peak of his s performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mids were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heartthrob all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid s with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as Hedge quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movieand it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with JMVs talent and his looks. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil as explored in Buster and Billie is much more dramatic! Anyway Glynnis OConnor is delightful as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting.

Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacaa an evil creature from myth & legend. Erm Im struggling now because not that much else actually happens...Written & directed by Scott Maginnis I wont beat about the bush here & simply say that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is awful period. The script only ever mentions the word Werewolf once & the rest of the time its referred to a Chupacaa in fact I suspect this wasnt really conceived as a Werewolf flick at all. The Werewolf creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesnt change back into anyone either. To be honest apart from the title theres nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a ripoff of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London (). This is the type of home made crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead () The Evil Dead () Halloween () or Friday the th () which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe The Blair Witch Project () but thats it in recent years & crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. The characters are awful & things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap Im sorry but I dont know how else to describe it.Director Maginnis does nothing to make this watchable theres the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick blink & youll miss something editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure. Its not scary theres no nudity theres no tension or atmosphere & the special effects are awful. The monster really does look poor & its no wonder Maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it. Theres virtually no colour to the picture either its either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well. The gore consists of some fake guts (blink & youll miss them!) a few bloody wounds & a severed arm big deal.With a supposed budget of about $ I admit the budget was low but I simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far. The whole thing has the look of a home movie it has no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at. The acting sucks too although you probably already knew that.Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think its a sequel to John Landis classic which it most certainly isnt & it isnt even a proper Werewolf flick either.

John Wayne would hardly be ones first choice as a cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bullrun in Harrods. But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style. The Duke was a guy who really could act well. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie. Many of his good intentions came a cropper. He had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battles. I cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. There was a great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. The set pieces were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought had been applied to it.The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flagwaving effort. Script was good without being too wordy. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didnt interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. Whether or not they were Japanese I couldnt say. But anyway they looked the part. At least the leads were not played by crossdressing Caucasians unlike other efforts such as Blood Alley (yes I know they were Chinese) The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness or even The King And I.Frankly I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. The script was better for a start. I never liked the songs in The King And I and wasnt impressed by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of Blood Alley.

I wouldnt be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from . For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner eaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what characters they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After  or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless.The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic exwife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourkes? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull.

But alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic.There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past  years and some of them have their charms. But its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result Hollow Man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.However the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing. When making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore the language (and sometimes the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up the good guys go Oh darn! and Oh my God. Hollow Man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. Im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear  but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.\n","neg: 0.085, neu: 0.706, pos: 0.209, compound: 0.994, \n","OK so it owes Pulp Fiction but in my opinion has its own voice and identity mainly because of the musicvideo direction style sketchlike narrative and great performances.

During the next  or  decades that followed Frances New Wavers caught everyones attention and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces. But in  Luchino Visconti ought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work *Death in Venice* which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down so did the great European filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola Scorsese & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of Viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the Visconti revealed here. Hes not playing to the crowd folks: either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. Incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmos.We will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies: one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann) one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti) one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde) and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background Gustav Mahlers th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahlers ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical east Visconti changes the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk). Bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance  a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.Cinema just doesnt get better than this. Ill ignore the complaints from the Ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns (i.e. which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?) and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what its mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself Visconti knew whereof he spoke.[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending with Bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face. Meanwhile off in the distance young Tadzio the object of Bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. [DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned* I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie.

Though I will concede that the ideas behind Batman Forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the case.Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series I fail to understand how Batman Returns can be considered at all disappointing.True it is not quite the equal of the first film  though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in Batman a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film true to the way the Batman was always meant to be and highly satisfying.Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken named in honour of the s German silent actor) his partnerincrime Oswald Cobblepot the Penguin (Danny DeVito in illiant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Oliviers Richard III) and Selina Kyle the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances especially Walken and DeVito while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a fourcornered fight. There simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats going on.Nevertheless this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.\n","neg: 0.06, neu: 0.833, pos: 0.107, compound: 0.9663, \n","The Quick and the Undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void.

It looked excellent when you take into account budget considerations.Unfortunately it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably The Good The Bad and The Ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... you know they have movies where characters do THIS!

With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas Rope took place all in one room. I didnt enjoy this one as much as Rope but thats not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a eak in between his more serious ones. As a thriller I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing. Intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends auptly leaving you empty inside.The film doesnt feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.The performances are there but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat.In the end I wanted more from this one.

The qualities of the book havent been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the s the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is ought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sues point of view then from Mauds one. The main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other.For each of her books the author Sarah Waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research.

I have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.What I hate is the people who ing the Bible and Religion into all of this. People forget there is more than one Bible thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion. Religion does not make everything fact one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is eaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one faic at one time slavery is OK and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this Oh that was the Old testament and now we have the New Testament. If the Bible is the word of God and cannot be changed..there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it that there Is no other way. The excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher. But anyhow onto the review. I am a decent fan of Ghost Hunters and when I heard this show was coming soon I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like watching Ghost Hunters I do not like some of their members and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on. Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not. I am glad they are skeptical but its like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as a fact not a belief. Its more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think its going to perform for you? This show is kind of silly. Its usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of psychics yet hardly anything happens. The main guys filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not needed.Also the reliance on psychics is too abundant as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believe.I really wanted to like this show but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed.\n","neg: 0.102, neu: 0.823, pos: 0.074, compound: -0.9086, \n","For a long time The Menagerie was my favorite Star Trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by City on the Edge of Forever. What I used to prefer about Menagerie was that its more hardcore Star Trek with this fascinating backstory to the thencurrent Trek storyline. I still think its fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a twopart episode. Though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot the idea of Spock being courtmartialed is a clever one. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For instance given the Talosians mindcontrol abilities and Captain Pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically ing Pike back to their planet?

This inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others but with much less success.Was it the so called Amazonian natives who looked like they were Bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in Sri Lanka) or the inept decapitation and castration scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in Cannibal Holocaust? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion it appeared as though Lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending where all loose ends are resolved. Most unsatisfying.As with the others where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully) the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.If there are any redeemable features at all Kerman is an affable if somewhat onedimensional leading man and his bevy of scantily clad costars (Agren Lai and Senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.\n","neg: 0.165, neu: 0.794, pos: 0.041, compound: -0.9951, \n","Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid.

I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of Americas true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. Ive seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonneguts genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best Ive seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching.

In direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isnt just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and uised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that Part Two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of Ches life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner.While the movies tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and faication as much as possible. This somewhat distant cold approach to telling Ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything the entirety of Che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a mans struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); Che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably conducted the whole thing.Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesnt feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points. Here the basic structure of Part One is echoed backtheres the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. Yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming and disquieting note. This difference in combination with the similarities to Part One make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means both could be digested one their own (and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.Indeed everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements dont necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. In fact upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One and title the review as a whole yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.With that said I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each parts ability to do just that. With a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movies characters without drawing attention to themselves Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.

Since then I tried  with an emphasis on tried  watching his other work SHADOWS in particular. I must admit it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film. At first the unpolished raw and improvised way Cassavetes it was shot put me off somewhat and I thought of it as an original  absolutely  but flawed and dated experiment. But now upon reviewing these little imperfections make it look so fresh even today.Shot on a minimal budget of $ with a skeleton six person crew SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an AfricanAmerican family in which two of the three siblings Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) are lightskinned and able to pass for white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing a reaction against seamless Hollywood production values. Cassavetes main inspiration  at least in the cinematic style the film was shot  were the Italian neorealists whilst also professing admiration for Welles pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neorealist directors but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus ans Shafi Hadi the film feels very different very American unlike anything made before really. The song with the feathered girls I feel like a lollypop (or something) feels like light years back to me ancient history. But no matter how dated it might look it still makes a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today. I think its this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film without Hollywood improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel who acted and was involved in SHADOWS claims it was Jules Dassins THE NAKED CITY () that was the first and inspired them all but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers.Camera Obscura  /\n","neg: 0.062, neu: 0.836, pos: 0.102, compound: 0.9634, \n","Based on an actual story John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss.

It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and as you know Saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place; makes complete sense and its then that you know you arent simply watching another silly s slasher with a pea ain plot. Thank god for that! Seriously though Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with its originality.

One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. Theres nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough) but thats not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows.

In fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her Chinese side. Its seems to the spectator that Suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them.Therefore Suyins attitudes always leave poor Elliott  a determined ave and extremely practical man  anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words. For him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear: if we love each other let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together. Not so fast is what she seems verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the time.In fact Suyins Chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. And as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equiliium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or nonphysical world. For Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of the English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion) but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings.In fact it looks like a whole bunch of Chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make peoples life totally miserable. Because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon; peasants are advised that they should shout loudly The rice is bad! The rice is bad! to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and in a funeral it is recommended that the deads family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.In other words Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyones daily life.As the story takes place in Hong Kong in  it should be clear that China really was at that time almost a semifeudal society while the country from which Elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the USA after the first oil shock in  took charge of the whole world. Therefore at least in one aspect both sides of Suyins Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today.A lot of History came into being since those old days. As to China the main fact is that after several phases of a communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as State capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled Suyin in Hong Kong in  and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned Elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It is gone completely gone! In ief if that story took place today Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual!\n","neg: 0.1, neu: 0.831, pos: 0.069, compound: -0.9879, \n","First and foremost I would like to say that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. Someone that cared about others appreciated others found no/barely any judgment against other people and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. When i watched it I didnt know particularly what it was about i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that I was clueless and as I began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters i was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise. The first time i watched it i was blind. Blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness as human beings to their relationship. I watched it a second time because i finally figured out how hypocritical I was being saying to myself and others Oh i accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear I suppose. The second time I watched this film I opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that Id heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love. And I loved it i loved the storyline i loved the slightly oken yet strong individual people in the film i loved the sharing of feelings and i loved the strong bonds created.

We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. Befittingly the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female white v.s. black and the individual v.s. society. But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. It did not attempt to show how either was right although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically this injustice that in some ways ings the two races together for a time. Lawrence Fishburne does an overthetop performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and downtrodden with the industrious and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university. It is a lifelearning process not a textual one.

(This film is confusing because the audience doesnt know what the story is.) I had no problem with the lowproduction values and the acting wasnt great but this is telly so it was fine. I dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a nonsensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.The prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed it wasnt clear what was happening ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution so I could fill in the details those pesky Communists. The prologue is best ignored.This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) It sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she says. Okay a soppy romance. No because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally sleazy) lunatic bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesnt work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find romcom romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that theyve even spent any time with each other.It could have been a thrillertype thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity. No the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better film.The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either.

Nothing other than a questionable sequel to MM. It wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.Basically from the plot outline verbatim an American diplomat David Huxley and his fiancée Tish Harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when in the end Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.I didnt like how this had nothing to do with the original MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didnt believe the words coming out of Davids mouth the whole time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery. I counted at least  ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.David was no heroic person throughout the film. You could guess he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect. There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tishs father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen) and a gay other character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS too because it wasnt even about a last eath. Nobody really dies.

This romantic drama was quite a treat. Im sure this story will not be everyones cup of tea especially considering the films darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.Alltime Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (Star Wars Raiders of the Lost Ark The Fugitive Air Force One Patriot Games) is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer Dutch. Fords very subdued nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in inging the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action first for director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump Back To The Future) in his summer  thriller What Lies Beneath and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancys The Sum Of All Fears. Fears will be Harrison Fords third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.Director Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa The Firm Tootsie) has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to ScottThomas congresswoman. Its a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director he is also one of the most believable natural and charming actors around (see Eyes Wide Shut as well).Kristin ScottThomas (The English Patient The Horse Whisperer) shows that you dont necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Fords quietman toughness.The subplots work wonderfully especially the subplot involving Fords characters investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by Heat actor Dennis Haysbert who plays Detective George Beaufort the obstacle to overcome in Dutchs investigation into police corruption.The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best characteractors around and Bonnie Hunt who I find extremely solid in this production steals most of her scenes with that wonderful charming smile as Wendy Judd.The technical side of Pollacks thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusins (Pollacks The Firm) perfectly surrealfeeling jazzy score to Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It) crisp photography to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh despite the films unfortunate downer premise.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery wellpaced plot characterdriven stories and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising yet poignant and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times.

Back in those days (the s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MSTk complete with bearded host.Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stonefaced deadpan filibuster Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show) boiled in a flask full of wellknown police television show plots and scenarios. This is distilled  times to produce the most pure policeman every made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a  ask Johnny the Leathery Old ShoeShine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. Cops get lucky also. Capt Drebin (notice hes a Captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner Nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of  golden episodes.The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quoteables. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the sight gagshowever. At its core was a nonsensical and straightfaced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as  minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Pythons And Now For Something Completely Different.....If you liked Airplane  &  Naked Gun  or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this.

Second of all through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Brocas films. On this account however I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely onedimensional.

However as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were riven by the controversy. I know as my two others would not speak to me for months afterward. But the commentary is in my view very onesided throughout.

This movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of  and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calie of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow I actually left for about  minutes halfway through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolies character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse hands). The movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with a lovesubplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolies character and Denzel Washingtons. Of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship as seen in the illian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling however even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie I was halfexpecting a plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking I even think the murderers intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and gets with his pet project Angelina.If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am) you will not appreciate this film.

I must say that Cinderella II: Dreams Come True is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all the movie was made during the height of Disneys sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as The Little Mermaid II The Jungle Book II and Peter Pan II all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and Atlantis II but Im going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.) Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films and I absolutely adore the original Disney Cinderella. The sequel to Cinderella however was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very outofcharacter moments with currentera phrasing like Im going to do this banquet my way! Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says Ewww! That is the antiCinderella. I try to find the best in people but in the sequel Anastasia one of the stepsisters is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original Cinderella when making this sequel? Well it surely doesnt seem so. If I remember correctly Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one Anastasia was evil. In the second one she is good. One just cant leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming Walt Disneys name.

This show while it has its fair share of grossout comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on Bams torturing of his parents.Im sorry to say this Bam but... youre in no way as cool as you think you are. This ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes I liked Jackass) but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly explaining that hes going to do whatever the f*** he wants to. How about you do something that is actually funny? I liked Jackass for what it was worth. The camerawork was horrible  any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents garage  but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.Not so with Viva la Bam. We follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. The stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.Viva la Bam is a poor spinoff of that does little good but feed Margeras already too big ego.

Like many others on here I dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be a drama there was no suspense so it cant be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there. Like the Blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. This movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next  minutes (well over half the film) nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies (the nurse said his liver was only grazed) and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with rd grade special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with  minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself.

Tsui set a tone for the New Waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Wong Jing Ching Siu Tung etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy. Burning Paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance.Its not that there isnt humor here; but it is a purely human humor as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just as humans are not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.When irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very incarnation of Miltons Satan from Paradise Lost: Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven! And if he cant get to Satans hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.Thats the motif underscoring the utal violence of much of the imagery here: Its not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality. Thus theres a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe and the Abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in charge.Of course fortunately the film doesnt end there. Though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell. Hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all.\n","neg: 0.156, neu: 0.751, pos: 0.093, compound: -0.9888, \n","Now I dont hate cheap movies.

When they arrive Karen goes in the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. He then discovers Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive they see no sign of Karen but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect.This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story once again. Rocky suggests that by Jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didnt think was important at the time but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. Its a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky isnt just some clueless old man either. As he says You come to me because Im your father. And Im smarter than you! This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts.This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker who played Angelique in the Dark Shadows series and went on to play Laura Banner Bruces wife in the Incredible Hulk series a few years later. She looks terrific here.This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family. This time its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend.Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent. I guess they figured it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly they were right though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl.

The other shows may have better matches but ive always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement.Im not going to reveal the winners of any match as i dont see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. I will comment on the quality of them though.We have the standard  matches and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw.Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. This proves to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match id recommend watching. Its hard to sum up without giving away the winner.Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is. Giant Gonzales Yokozuna Kamala... well this time its Heidenreich. Its also a casket match. Typical Undertaker fare. Watch if youre a fan. I have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.The next two matches are the title matches. For once Smackdown manages to upstage Raw. Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anticlimax and let down to end it. Raws match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as im a fan of both guys involved.Now to the main reason i love the event the rumble. Its a pretty good one this year. Coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable. There are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. There is the token guy who doesnt make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant.

Bat People (which I saw under the title It Lives By Night) is just such a movie. You cant watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on Night Gallery and not one of the better ones either. The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a WereBat who drinks human blood.

Meanwhile the worlds most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the utal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino).

Its just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involved.I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite BUT:)The director needed to beat Michael Pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT and not just channel Dennis Weaver. )He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole Bat Bites Human Who Then Turns Into A Bat scenario. ) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes instead of resorting to Man Has A Seizure page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. ) He needed to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant.

However here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film: Handgun bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons. It doesnt matter how many times you shoot at the Komodo bullets just wont go near it. The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Coa or a giant Komodo dragon is just to stand there. The exception to this rule is if youve been told to stay very still in which case you should run off until the Komodo is right next to you and then you should stand there expecting defeat. Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching. $ is a memory enhancement tool and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested. Members of elite army units dont see giant Komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the oversized beings. Maybe the computergenerated nature of these dragons has something to do with it. When filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear a second camera microphones etc are all superfluous. When you hear a loud animal scream and one person has a gun he should take it out and point it at the nearest person. When you take a gun out the sound of the safety being taken off will be made even if your finger is nowhere near the safety Reporters agree to go halfway around the world in order to expose something  without having the faintest idea what theyre exposing. Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism. Handguns hold at least  bullets in one clip and then more than that in the next clip. Despite that those with guns claim that they will need more ammo. Expensive cameras (also remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moments hesitation or regret. These cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves. The blonde girl really is the stupid one. The same girl that says not to go into a house because a Komodo dragon can easily run right through it thus making it unsafe takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection  and nobody says a word about it. Hightech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets. Geneticallymodified snakes grow from normal size to  feet long in a matter of a day but dont grow at all in the weeks either side. The military routinely destroys entire islands when people dont meet contact deadlines. Men with guns dont necessarily change the direction theyre shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead they just keep shooting into the air.

So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links  but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) Im sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock wasnt too bad  but hes no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the  minor  Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! Theres no such thing as a  minor  Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design theyre as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress  Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor  Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of Americas greatest living character actors Best Actor  Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress  Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director  Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because hed never won one . Actually Im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for TAXI DRIVER  RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didnt deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film  MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDBs controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past  I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts\n"]}],"source":["print(df['Text'].iloc[410] ) # sentence with index 410 has the highest compound score\n","                             # and hence it is the most important sentence among all the sentences."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BaHHb4vj5cOi"},"source":["## Finding top positive sentence in the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":55,"metadata":{"id":"iDtkxxHH5cOi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695785713290,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Madhan Kumar","userId":"12147968945657818169"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["pos_sent=df.sort_values(by='pos', ascending=False)\n","## Arranging the dataframe by positive column in descending order to find the best postive sentence."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":56,"metadata":{"id":"84zDH3h85cOi","outputId":"60dd8598-178f-4c06-d595-640951732909","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695785715352,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Madhan Kumar","userId":"12147968945657818169"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  Text    neg    neu    pos  \\\n","161  MYSTERY MEN has got to be THE stupidest film I...  0.099  0.446  0.455   \n","10   If you like original gut wrenching laughter yo...  0.098  0.511  0.391   \n","322  I have watched this movie countless times and ...  0.000  0.662  0.338   \n","382  This film was pretty good.
